description: Corrosion often occurs quietly. Attention is not paid, and damage
  happens unexpectedly. Solutions are not easy, and decisions are expensive. In
  these situations, awareness opportunities about corrosion prevention and
  protection are lost. If we do not feel, we do not notice it. Sensing is very
  important, and fortunately, possibilities are increasing. We are talking about
  sensorics. It is the technology branch concerning optical, electronic,
  magnetic, etc., devices able to answer to changes like composition,
  temperature, pressure, light, and so, in any system and report them as a way
  of monitoring what is happening according to our interest (flow, level,
  chemistry, size, etc.). Sensorics is one of the emerging technologies that
  converge in the establishment of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution.
  Options of corrosion monitoring are increasing, and a general improvement of
  the awareness about corrosion of materials and asset deterioration is also
  expected. To know about some of the sensors that have been developed during
  the last decades for monitoring corrosion is useful for solving current and
  coming corrosion engineering issues, applying such tools or others even more
  developed. The following are three examples of patents concerning corrosion
  sensing inside pipelines. An expired patent, another in force, and the last
  one just asked. As we can see in these three examples of inventions concerning
  corrosion sensing and monitoring, technology has been evolved very quickly
  from simple mechanical designs just a few decades ago towards very
  sophisticated innovations right now.

Corrosion often occurs quietly. Attention is not paid, and damage happens unexpectedly. Solutions are not easy, and decisions are expensive. In these situations, awareness opportunities about corrosion prevention and protection are lost. If we do not feel, we do not notice it. Sensing is very important, and fortunately, possibilities are increasing. We are talking about sensorics. It is the technology branch concerning optical, electronic, magnetic, etc., devices able to answer to changes like composition, temperature, pressure, light, and so, in any system and report them as a way of monitoring what is happening according to our interest (flow, level, chemistry, size, etc.). Sensorics is one of the emerging technologies that converge in the establishment of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. Options of corrosion monitoring are increasing, and a general improvement of the awareness about corrosion of materials and asset deterioration is also expected. To know about some of the sensors that have been developed during the last decades for monitoring corrosion, is useful for solving current and coming corrosion engineering issues, applying such tools or others even more developed. The following are three examples of patents concerning corrosion sensing inside pipelines. An expired patent, another in force, and the last one just asked. As we can see in these three examples of inventions concerning corrosion sensing and monitoring, technology has been evolved very quickly from simple mechanical designs just few decades ago towards very sophisticated innovations right now.

​

**Expired exclusivity**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** 3,718,034

**Title:** Hydraulic corrosion monitoring coupon injector

**Inventor (s):** Dean E. Swearingen

**Applicant (s):** Dean E. Swearingen

**Priority date:** 27.02.1973

**Summary:** The awarded patent concerned the invention of a hydraulic system for the introduction and then, the retirement of a coupon temporally exposed to the aggressiveness of a fluid flowing through a pipeline. The assembly includes a pair of controlling valves, a cylinder, a piston rod hydraulicly actuated, and a securely connected plate coupon in its free end.

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** the United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** 7,274,443

**Title:** Corrosion monitoring system, optical corrosion probe, and methods of use.

**Inventor (s):** Michael Ponsting, Jess Ford, and Anthony Johnson.

**Applicant (s):** Custom Sensors and Technology.

**Date of patent:** 25.09.2007

**Summary:** This is an invention about the remote measurement of the corrosion level by following the evolution of the light reflected from a coating exposed to an aggressive stream in processes pipes transporting crude-oil or industrial water. An optical substrate is used to detect reflected light, including the spectra from ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light wavelengths. And the signal is sent by optical fiber from the probe towards a processor, where comparisons are made, and results are extrapolated to corrosion rates.

​

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** China National Intellectual Property Administration - CNIPA

**Application No.:** 113390778

**Title:** Optical fiber sensor with temperature compensation for monitoring internal corrosion of oil and gas pipeline

**Author(s):** Tang Fujian, Kuang Yihang, Li Hongnan, Zhou Xia

**Applicant (s):** Dalian University of Technology

**Priority date:** 14.09.2021

**Summary:** In the same way that the previous invention, this development is concerned with a monitoring system for sensing the internal corrosion in O&G pipelines. The system comprises a sensing unit, including a Fabry-Perot interferometric fiber-optic sensor and a temperature compensation unit. Authors claim an invention about a low labor cost sensor, easy to operate, with variable sensitivity, and wide in the coverage range of the pipe diameter and flow rate.

**Modern-time steel creates new challenges to tackle**

In the frame of a Swedish Triple Helix partnership between the*[ Metals Research Institute - Swerim](https://www.swerim.se/en)* and *[Alfa Laval Technologies AB](https://www.alfalaval.com/)*, and funded by *[Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/en/)*, the national innovation agency, *[research](https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/hard-x-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy-study-of-oxide-films-on-additively-manufactured-stainless-steel/)* about the corrosion behavior of additively manufactured stainless steel. The research procedure includes the irradiation of polished AM samples by an ambient pressure X-ray beam to evaluate the in-situ corrosion properties of the stainless steel. The study’s primary goal is to get information about the effect of the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment on chemical reactions in the corrosive environment..

​

**Once again, the solutions come from mimicking nature**

Researchers from the University of Southern Queensland recently published a *[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2021.12.009)* concerning the *[invention](https://www.aumanufacturing.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Video-S6-Burning-process-of-coated-wood.mp4?_=1)* of a lava-inspired fire-retardant coating. It is a micro/nano structured organic-inorganic composite coating, exceptionally protecting materials like wood and steel from fire. The composite comprises low-melted glass powders as ceramic precursors, boron nitride nanosheets as synergists, and a fire-retardant polymer as a matrix. Then*[,](https://twitter.com/i/status/1482867797655158787)* the coating forms an extremely fire protection lava-like ceramic char layer upon exposure to flame.
