  institutions, companies, and other entities committed to the WCO mission of
  promoting education and best practices concerning corrosion control for the
  socio-economic benefit of society, preservation of resources, and protection
  of environments. In other words, an organization fully aligned with the
  Sustainable Development Objectives – SDO - of the UN and the challenges that
  we Corrosionists are facing in front of the post-globalization threats and
  options. The motto of the WCO is “Rising Awareness About Corrosion and
  Corrosion Protection Around the World.” The UN has declared April 24 as the
  “International Corrosion Awareness Day,” and the WCO has overseen promoting
  this date as an opportunity of joining efforts towards a common purpose for
  all and every Corrosionist in the world. “Audience” is growing, and year after
  year, celebration activities increase. To know some of the programmed events
  is exciting, and to take part in them is a duty for all the people convinced
  of the growing importance of materials and assets protection as an answer to
  the threats of sustainability, health, and socio-economical inequities that
  are stressing our planet and we, the civilization of the 21 century and
  beyond.

The World Corrosion Organization – *[WCO](https://corrosion.org/)*, is an international non-profit charitable, non-governmental umbrella organization – NGO – of the United Nations – *[UN](https://www.un.org/en/)*. Members of WCO are national and international institutions, companies, and other entities committed to the WCO mission of promoting education and best practices concerning corrosion control for the socio-economic benefit of society, preservation of resources, and protection of environments. In other words, an organization fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Objectives – SDO - of the UN and the challenges that we Corrosionists are facing in front of the post-globalization threats and options. Founder members are the International Corrosion Council – *[ICC](https://icc-net.org/)*, which groups more than one hundred national entities dealing with corrosion and protection, the European Federation of Corrosion - *[EFC](https://efcweb.org/)*, and the Chinese Society for Corrosion and Protection – CSCP. Some of the other current members are the Austrian Society for Metallurgy and Materials – *[ASMET](https://asmet.org/)*, the French Center for Corrosion and Protection – *[CEFRACOR, ](http://www.cefracor.org/)*the Corrosion Science Society of Korea – *[CSSK](http://en.www.corrosionkorea.org/about/about01.php)*, the Spanish Materials Society - *[SOCIEMAT](https://sociemat.es/)*, THE Portuguese Society of Materials - *[SPM](https://spmateriais.pt/site/)*, *[AkzoNobel](https://www.akzonobel.com/)*, and *[Magna International](https://www.magnachem.com.sg/)*.
