# **THE FAITHFUL SQUIRE - Part II**

**A whimsical market**

The fourth engineering metal, by tons, consumed after iron, copper, and aluminum is zinc (the 23rd most abundant element in the Earth's crust). Yearly production shows a growing trend of about 1 percent. A growing from 14.0 million tons in 2018, the predicted production for 2035 is about 16.5 million tons. Taking into account that 60 percent of consumption goes to galvanizing steel, we are talking of 8.4 and 9.9 million tons, respectively —a small amount of about two hundred times less than crude steel production. One of the reasons for this huge difference concerns the fact that currently, only 6 percent of the steel produced annually is coated **[\-Source-](https://www.zinc.org/)**. For instance, in India, of a total annual steel sheet production, only around eight million tons (7 percent) are zinc coated. Meanwhile, in Japan, it is 11 percent, and in the USA, it is 19 percent. From another point of view, the yearly average global per capita galvanized steel consumption is 2 kg. Besides, consumption by country shows huge differences. In Italy, it is 24 kg, in Germany, 17 kg, in Spain, 15 kg, in the UK, 13 kg, in France, 11 kg, in Chile, 7.8 kg, in Colombia, 1.7 kg, in Brazil and Mexico, 1.3 kg, and in India, 0.6 kg per person.

​

**A culture to transform**

Without any doubt, further than economic or technical reasons to justify both the low consumption and the huge gaps between regions and countries, there are cultural reasons. Such a situation may be associated with the concern about the gap between existing knowledge and anticorrosive measurements in the field. In other words, one of the explanations of the high corrosion problems, after more than a century of systematic research, technological development, training, and education by universities, research centers, companies, associations, and so on. T.P. Hoar, in his study about the cost of corrosion in the UK 50 years ago, found that the annual total cost in the country was £ 2500 million, and the avoidable cost was estimated at one-fifth of such amount. According to Hoar, the main reason for this situation was a lack of corrosion awareness. The current situation is similar. Fortunately for the galvanizing sector, this situation is an opportunity for new and bigger markets to improve the reduction of the impact of corrosion and achieve more sustainable development. Here, corrosionists have the opportunity to beat for more rational engineering management: to look for a condition in which **each material occupies its rightful place**. A glimpse about new market options stars taking into account the current applications of galvanized steel. As an example, the percentage distribution in Germany is construction 49, industrial equipment 12.5, transport/vehicles 11, agriculture 7.5, road equipment 6.5, utilities 4.5, small parts 4.5, and others 4.5.

​

**Benefits offered**

​

**Cheap long term**

Further than the strengthening of the counter corrosion measurements by galvanization, there are some other reasons to think about the importance of a cultural change associated with the increase of Zn usage as a coating of carbon steel. Announced advantages according to providers and associations, including the cost of protection when galvanizing is one of the options. The American Galvanizers Association offers a free **[tool](http://lccc.galvanizeit.org/report/b48231c9d4f208b3c80d57139c47ea3e)** to estimate the initial cost and the total one after the desired life-cycle. For instance, for the desired life of 30 years of exposure in a moderate aggressive environment, the final cost of the hot-dip galvanizing is the same that the initial cost of $ 1.67 US dollars per square foot. But in the case of a protective coating system including a primer of inorganic zinc, epoxy, and polyurethane for the finishing, the initial cost is estimated as $ 2.28 US dollars, and the final one will be $ 5.34 US dollars.

​

**Towards a more sustainable world**

This is another feature that can be highlighted. Concerning raw materials extraction, there are comparisons on data, keeping in mind that values depend on factors like nature and grade of the ores and the process followed. In general terms, Zn shows good figures about its environmental impact:

**​[Australian researchers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.06.018)** compared some variables concerning the environmental impact in all stages of the metal productive life cycle, included a cumulative amount of primary energy consumption or gross energy requirement (GER), solid waste burden (SWB), global warming potential (GWP), and acidification potential (AP). In summary, Zn is a low energy-intensive metal, and less pollutant than Ni, Al, Ti, and stainless steel. It is only surpassed by carbon steel and Pb. Furthermore, an interesting comparison is the relatively low added amounts by the galvanizing process on steel. In the beginning, GER and GWP of steel are estimated as 23 MJ/kg and 2.3 kg CO2 equivalent/kg, respectively. The added amounts associated with the galvanization process are 3.4 to 5.3 MJ/kg and 0.10 to 0.33 kg CO2 equivalent/kg. Figures that are also presented as advantageous in front of usually repeated maintenance painting of steel structures.\
​

**A vital element**

Zn is essential for life and plays a specific role in several biological reactions. It is necessary for plants, animals, and humans. It is naturally present in the ecosystem (air, waters, and soils). Some of the average concentrations in natural environments are 0.01 – 0.2 µg/m3 in rural air, 10-300 mg/kg in soils, 0.001 – 0.06 µg/L in open ocean, and 0.5 – 1.0 µg/L in coastal/inland seas. Too little Zn in a person can generate a loss of appetite, decreased sense of taste and smell, slow wound healing, and skin sores. However, as it happens with many other chemical elements and compounds, too much Zn can cause health problems. Consequently, Zn is included in the list of substance regulations. Nevertheless, maximum permitted concentrations are higher than the concentrations of other common engineering metals. As an example, maximum permissible concentrations of some metallic elements, in mg per kg of dry soil (maximum soil metal concentrations that give full protection to soil organisms, processes and functions, as well as protection of humans directly or indirectly in contact with the soil, and protection of surrounding ecosystems) according to the Danish regulations, are 3 of Hg, 5 of Cd, 20 of As, 30 of Ni, 400 of Pb, 500 of Cu, and 1000 of Zn **[\-Source-](https://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/Publications/2001/87-7944-519-5/html/kap06_eng.htm)**.\
​

**Sometimes Zn shows its “true color”**

This squire is not away a proper partner. In some cases, there are limitations to overcome. In principle, there are limitations to its characteristics themselves. Zn whit a density of 7.11 g/cm3 is a member of the heavy metals group, together with iron, copper, tin, silver, gold, platinum, and so on. Like the other members of the group, it is a nutrient, but it can be toxic in larger amounts. Also, this characteristic is associated with an unfavorable higher environmental impact, as opposed to light metals (aluminum, magnesium, and titanium), when we are considering applications where the strength-to-weight ratio is relevant. Concerning the galvanizing process, there are some technical limitations, but in fact, they are challenges to solve. In principle, the process is considered a rather complex technological one. Besides, a truly effective galvanized can only be applied industrially (not manually), only on dismantled parts (not assemblies), coating repairs require treatment of the entire part, and all the job must be done at the shop site (is not possible in the field). Furthermore, the size of the treatment tanks and furnaces in the shop is a rigid limitation about the size of the parts to be treated. Finally, there are limitations related to the behavior of the Zn coating. Thermodynamic restrictions include the reversing of the polarity of the pair Fe/Zn when the temperature rises above 60°C, limiting the use of Zn to ambient temperature applications. Another restriction deals with the presence of impurities as Fe, able to produce intermetallic compounds which will set up local galvanic cell on the anode, increasing the so call self-corrosion, with a sharp drop in efficiency. A metallurgical barrier is associated with the requirements concerning the composition of the steel substrate to be galvanized because some elements in certain amounts are deleterious for the galvanizing quality. Another big limitation is connected with situations where the kinetics of the corrosion process of Zn is not the advantage. In other words, passivation does not occur in acidic and other severe environments. In such situations, the reinforcement of the protection by painting over the Zn coating, or duplex system, is often used. Here, the problem is that the glossy, low roughness Zn surface has not a proper anchorage for most of the paints. Adherence is low and difficult to obtain, and only special and expensive paints work.

​

**Recent improvements**

​

**Playing with the elements**

Looking for answers to the above-mentioned challenges, in the last 50 years, have been done with big efforts. Advances in metallurgical issues and the technology of the process have improved the benefits of galvanizing. On one side, developments concerning the composition of the coating have been proposed and launched to the market. Zn alloys instead of pure Zn have been well-positioned. Galvalume® coated steel sheet with 55 % of Al was developed and has been sold by Bethlehem Steel Corporation since 1972. Currently, it is widely used in civil construction, mainly for roofing and cladding applications (also under other trademarks like Zincalume® or Aluzinc®). The 55%Al-Zn coated steel shows mechanical properties slightly different from zinc-coated steel, due to the higher molten metal temperature and also to the higher yield, tensile strength, lower total elongation, and hardening coefficient. Also, alloys with higher Zn content have been studied. V.gr, a patent was given by the World Intellectual Property Organization in 1981 (WO1981002748A1) claimed for the invention of alloys containing from about 85% to about 97% zinc, from about 3% to about 15% aluminum and from about 5 ppm to about 1.0% of rare-earth elements. A current commercial alloy is 95% zinc/5% aluminum. Furthermore, and more recently, another alloy (90-92% Zn/8-10% Fe) have been obtained by heating the zinc-coated steel between 450 and 550 °C immediately after passing through the molten zinc bath. Consequently, iron from the substrate diffuses into the coating, and the coating becomes higher corrosion resistance, formability, and weldability.

​

**Gambling to the process**

Instead of the general batch galvanization process, there is continuous or in-line sheet galvanizing. This is also a hot-dip process but only applied to steel sheet, strip, and wire. A special characteristic of continuous galvanized steel is greater control and preciseness of the coating thickness. As a result, coated steel sheets are well-engineered products, useful for the manufacture of highly demanding items. The coating lines are classified as light, intermediate, and heavy-gauge. Product from light-gauge lines is used mostly for applications as corrugated roofing sheets, and building sidewall panels. The largest application for the product made on intermediate-gauge lines is car body panels and appliances. Products from heavy-gauge lines are used for applications like culvert pipe, ductwork, and automotive structural parts. Under such conditions, opportunities for new and significant applications have been opened. One of them, just mentioned above, is on more corrosion resistant, thinner, and lighter car bodies. Moreover, the alluring option of continuous rebar galvanizing.\
