It is great to refresh the calendar pages and to expect a much better future, supported by our promises. It is good to know that a promise by most of the Corrosionists is to strengthen our innovative efforts. This is the expectation, and undoubtedly 2022 will be a year plentiful of good news for all our community. Therefore, right now is time to have some inspiration, and the summaries below are examples of how to proceed. They are three of the more recent applications of patents concerning interesting issues about simple anticorrosive measurements that we can use for inspiring us to face the challenge of being more innovative than ever.

​\
​

**A corrosion-resistant material against the aggressive conditions in fuel cells.** The first example is related to one of the common problems currently found in developing alternative energy sources as the fuel cells are. The stability of the materials of the cells has been a challenge for decades. In this case, an option of using a mixture of dopped Mg and Ti oxides fulfills both functions of conducting electricity and standing in front of the aggressiveness of the severe environment.

​\
​

**Localizing and monitoring submerged pipelines robotically**. It is presented a technological development closely related to growing problems about pipeline leakages. Then the subsequent concerns about contamination and sustainability could be avoided. The proposed development is related to a new equipment and its operation. It is an apparatus that can localize submerged pipelines and monitor their corrosion rates.

​\
​

**More resistant coatings by using natural organic substances**. In the end, it is presented a patent request about an electrocoating, including a higher edge corrosion resistance due to the inclusion of chitosan, the polysaccharide extracted from crustaceans’ shells, in the formula of the electrolytic bath.

​

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** US Patent & Trademark Office - USPTO

**Application No.:** 20210130186A1

**Title:** *Conductive, anticorrosive magnesium titanium oxide material*

**Author(s):** Soo KIM, Jonathan Mailoa, Lei Cheng, and Charles Tuffile

**Applicant(s):** Robert Bosch GmbH

**Priority date:** 20.03.2020.

**Summary:** The submitted invention is concerned with a mixture of Mg and Ti oxides doped with elements like Ge, Nb, Mo, Sn, Ta, or W. The resulting compound is a multiphasic conductive material, useful as bipolar plate catalyst support in fuel cells.

**Application No.:** 3922544A1

**Title:** *Measuring platform and method for finding and monitoring pipelines underwater*

**Author(s):** Walter Siegmund

**Applicant(s):** Scan4pipes Europe GmbH

**Priority date:** 06.08.2020.

**Summary:** In this case, the claim concerns the design and operation of an instrument helpful in locating submerged pipelines and monitoring their corrosion behavior. The floating equipment includes sensors for the measurements, driving elements, and the corresponding units for detecting positions, data transmission, and the equipment controls.

​

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** European Patent Office - EPO

**Application No.:** 3922686A1

**Title:** *Electrocoating composition*

**Author(s):** Harshit Gupta, Konstantinos Markou, Hanxiang Zeng, and Thomas Huesmann

**Applicant(s):** Axalta Coating Systems IP Co LLC

**Priority date:** 21.05.2021.

**Summary:** A new composition for a protective coating obtained by electrodeposition in a 1% acetic acid-water solution at 25 °C is presented. The formula includes chitosan as a special additive to especially protect the substrate edges against corrosion. Also, a pigment paste is included. After the electrolysis, baking of the deposited film is applied.

**Taking care of the latest engineering marvel**

​

As a Christmas gift for humankind, last 25 of December was *[launched](https://www.space.com/news/live/james-webb-space-telescope-updates)* the James Webb Space Telescope – JWST (the man who ran NASA from 1961 – 1969), from Kourou, French Guinea, South America. This scientific instrument has resulted from more than 30 years of collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope is currently going to its final position, 1.6 million km away from earth. The primary purpose of the JWST is to let scientists dive more profound in the understanding of the universe, including issues like the planets chemical composition (water presence, mineral composition, etc.), the stars and the galaxies origin, exoplanets (planets outside the solar system) identification and characterization, and many other signs of activity or information crossing the extraterrestrial space. The whole instrument is 6.2 tons heavy, including the three main components: The mirrors, primary and secondary, the sun shield, and the unit with all the electronic sensors, controls, and scientific instruments. All the development of the JWST, from the design until its launching, has meant significant progress in engineering. The primary mirror, 6.5 m diameter, includes 18 hexagonal segments of 1.32 m diameter and about 20 kg each. The segments’ substrate is beryllium because of its properties as good conductivity of electricity and heat, good relationship weight to strength, and nonmagnetic behavior. After polishing and improving the reflectivity of infrared light, the substrate is coated with a layer of gold of about 100 nm, applied by vacuum vapor deposition. Finally, a film of amorphous SiO2 (as glass) is deposited on the top, looking for better resistance to the space environmental conditions. The mirror and the instruments are protected by a kite sun shield of 21 m by 14 m. This shield is a composite including five layers of Kapton, a polyimide film developed by Dupont 50 years ago. A polymeric film that can support temperature fluctuations between 6 and 650 K. The film is coated with a 100 nm thick aluminum film. Finally, a 50 nm thick top coating of doped silicon is applied, looking for optimal properties and longevity. Furthermore, the layers are built according to the so-called thermal spot bond - TSB. The resulting structure is a unique fabric that minimizes the damage by small bodies eventually hitting the sun shield. In the end, a remarkable engineering creation, exposed to strange aggressive conditions but carefully prepared.
