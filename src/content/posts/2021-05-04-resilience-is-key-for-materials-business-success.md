  Own estimation about the global cost of corrosion in 2019 said that it was
  about USD $4.8 T. It is understandable that a more significant proportion of
  the metallic surfaces in use are exposed to the atmosphere. Calculations about
  the proportion shown that around 80% of the metallic surfaces are faced with
  atmospheric corrosion. Consequently, 30 to 50% of the cost of corrosion could
  be related to atmospheric corrosion. This means that approximately 1.5 to 2.4
  trillion US dollars may have been the cost generated by the deleterious effect
  of the atmosphere on metallic materials in 2019 worldwide. Studies about

# **RESILIENCE IS KEY FOR MATERIALS BUSINESS SUCCESS.​**

**A noticeable problem**

**​**Own **[estimation](https://news.materials.business/19/01/2021/engineering-materials-the-real-cost)** about the global cost of corrosion in 2019 said that it was about USD $4.8 T. It is understandable that a more significant proportion of the metallic surfaces in use are exposed to the atmosphere. Calculations about the proportion shown that around 80% of the metallic surfaces are faced with atmospheric corrosion. Consequently, 30 to 50% of the cost of corrosion could be related to atmospheric corrosion. This means that approximately 1.5 to 2.4 trillion US dollars may have been the cost generated by the deleterious effect of the atmosphere on metallic materials in 2019 worldwide. Studies about atmospheric corrosion problems and solutions are noteworthy, including paints, alloys, design practices, etc. But the issues are still huge. The main reason for such a situation is that corrosive manipulation is generally away from the control of Corrosionists. Atmospheric pollution is the culprit. News about the identification of the problems dates back to 1661 when John Evelyn in his book “Fumifugium: Or the Inconvenience of the Aer and Smoake of London Dissipated” wrote, “….this is that pernicious Smoake … spoyling the moveables, tarnishing the Plate, Gildings and Furniture, and corroding the very Iron-bars and hardest Stones….” Five years later, Christopher Wren, designer of the Saint Paul London cathedral, warned of the need to prevent corrosion of the atmosphere, saying “in cramping of stones, no iron should lie within nine inches of air if possible.” This was the time of the emergence of an economy based on fossil fuels, coal at the beginning, and the starting point of the First Industrial Revolution. Three and a half centuries of urban pollution encompassed industrial development—pollution directly related to the deterioration of materials exposed to the atmosphere. According to the dose-response functions established for many places, many of the corrosion costs mentioned before are linked to the concentration of anthropogenic pollutants like SOₓ, NOₓ, CO₂, particulate matter, and acidic species thrown into the air.



​**Breaking the rhythm**

**​A tiny break**

After 300 years, the situation in London and other cities in developed countries significantly improved. Economic forces moved contamination to other regions, and an excellent example of severe pollution problems during the last decades has been Beijing with its famous and dangerous smog clouds. After the Second World War, macroeconomic trends, mostly related to workforce costs and quality of life concerns in rich countries, moved most of the more pollutant manufacturing plants to the less developed countries. Examples other than London, where factories were dismantled and the air became better, are Pittsburgh (U.S.A.), Torino (Italy), and Bilbao (Spain), three of the former “industrial cities” and archetypes of the industrialized world. A **[summary](https://doi.org/10.3390/ma10080969)** of the downward trend in Europe between 1987 and 2014 shows that all levels of major atmospheric pollutants are decreasing linearly. Looking at **[data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/so-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes)** about SO₂ emissions, between 1980 and 2010, the total emissions fell from 71.25 million tons to 19.79 million tons. In the case of South America, the change was 8.76 million tons to 6.56 million tons. Such a trend is supported by specific data as the Bogota figures, which show that in 1998 the average SO₂ concentration was 27 µg.m⁻³ and had fallen to 5 µg.m⁻³ in 2012. Globally, less polluting fuels are a common concern. In Latin America, deindustrialization and transference of industrial plants transfer to the countryside are two of the additional factors.

​

**A sudden inflection point**

In 2020, pandemics held out humankind against an immeasurable crisis. We have emphasized the adverse effects of quarantine on the acceleration and invigoration of the corrosive attack. A worsening of the problems due to the changes in the industrial operation regimes, the lack of control, interruptions on anticorrosive practices, the pause on training at all levels, etc. Thinking about the situation of materials exposed to the atmosphere, worries are the same. However, considering the atmospheric pollutants, we must say that these species play an active role in the crisis because the populations living in polluted regions are more sensitive to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, there is a **[potential effect](about:blank)** of air pollution acting as a physical carrier of the virus. But the news to be specially highlighted as being the reduction of pollutants together lockdown. For **[example](http://example/)**, in April 2020, there were measured reductions in the NO₂ concentrations in traffic stations in Spain, France, and Italy of about 60 – 70%. Something similar was found with particulate matter, too. Changes in consumer patterns have been drastic, and the major sectors contributing to CO₂ emissions (power, industry, and surface transport) underwent significant reductions. As a **[result](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0797-x)**, in the same month of April, the average daily global emissions of CO₂ decreased by 17%, from about 100 million tons to about 83 million tons.

​

**The change we need**

​**[According](https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020)** to the UN Environment Program (UNEP), since 2010, major greenhouse gas –GHG (CO₂, methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O)) emissions have grown at 1.4% per year on average. However, for 2020, initial data indicate that the yearly decrease in SO₂ emissions was approximately 7%; meanwhile, the drop in the GHG emissions was only more than 1.2%. These values suggest that the objectives of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement are challenging to achieve, but the lockdown has shown pathways. The primary purpose is to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above preindustrial times by 2100 instead of the currently predicted three degrees. Prospective risks of this warming are related to a cascade of potentially catastrophic impacts, including increases in extreme weather, rising sea level, flooding many coastal cities, the destruction of natural ecosystems, and damage to agricultural systems. As a countermeasure, humans must reduce emissions by 2.7% each year from 2020 to 2030. If we prefer to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the **[reduction](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-daily-co2-emissions)** must be 7.6% yearly, and **[45% in total](https://youtu.be/Ycn-l5Nd7uw)**, during the coming decade. Most of the most polluting countries have committed to the goal of net-zero emissions. Some of them, like China, have set some decades as their deadlines. In the case of the second pollutants emitter, the U.S.A. President has **[announced](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-01071-2)** a commitment to curb GHG emissions to at least 50% below 2005 levels by the end of this decade (reducing emissions of about 2.000 million tons). Specific actions mentioned at the outset include decarbonizing the electricity sector by 2035 and electrifying vehicles. The European Union has announced its goal of curbing emissions to 55% below 1990 levels by 2030.

​

**Good news for materials and assets**

​**[Studies](https://doi.org/10.3390/ma10080969)** on the behavior of materials exposed to several European atmospheres since the 1980s show that corrosion rates of materials like carbon steel, weathering steel, zinc, copper, and limestone decreased abruptly during the first ten years. Then, corrosion rates on metallic materials followed slowly falling, mainly in urban sites. In principle, an international purpose of net-zero emission looking for saving our planet is a trend towards atmospheres free of anthropogenic pollutants, turning urban and industrial corrosive atmospheres into something like rural ones. Such kind of conventional classification of corrosive atmospheres must change. Materials life-span will increase. Protection measurements may be more modest. Corrosionists and engineers, in general, must establish new design and materials selection guidelines; maintenance requirements will decrease; materials and anticorrosion businesses will have to be rethought.

**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**
