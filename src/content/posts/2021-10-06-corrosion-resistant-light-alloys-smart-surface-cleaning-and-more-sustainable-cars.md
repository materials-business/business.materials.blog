  A new overview of the files of the six most representative patent offices in
  the world provides us with three new inspiring papers on facing corrosion
  problems with innovation. Just a reminder that all our community of
  corrosionists, independent of the level of expertise, or the working place,
  can look for novel solutions. Many times. These solutions are prone to become
  protected knowledge and patenting is one interesting way. A pathway for
  constructing intellectual capital and intangible but valuable assets.

  More than anodized aluminum. When significant changes in materials handling are happening, Al alloys appear as an important option in several applications where requirements as light weight, easy processing, good conductivity, and relatively low price are becoming relevant. This is the reason why new anticorrosive options of aluminum alloys are attractive. One option is the expired patent concerning a conversion coating developed for the specific application of aluminum parts for semiconductor equipment. However, today we can think of other applications that use the same or similar protective coating.

  Smart surface cleaning and drying. Tesla has been awarded a patent concerning the employment of a laser beam to detect and remove dirt from the windshield. Laser technique has several applications on anticorrosion practice. This is a different and special application of laser beams to the surface cleaning of glass. However, we can remember a kind of innovation called “crossed innovation” or the application of the idea in a different business. This is the case if we think about the possibility of applying a laser beam to control sooting, wetting, and other kinds of surface contamination, and the subsequent risk of corrosion.

  ​Better stainless steels for sustainability. At the end of the day, we have an application on the development of new steels for brake discs for wear reduction. Consequently, the thickness and weight of the disc could be reduced, and cars will be less energy demanding and more eco-friendly.

**Expired exclusivity**

**​**

**Patent granter:** Japan Patent Office – JPO

**Patent No.:** JP2009128191A

**Title:** *Corrosion resistant aluminum article for semiconductor process*

**Author (s):** Craig A. Bercaw, Laxman Murugesh, Joshua E. Byrne

**Applicant (s):** Applied Materials Inc.

**Priority date:** 12. 07.1996

**Summary:** Therewas developed a highpurity Al-Mg alloy (0.1 to 1.5% Mg) and a maximum of 0.2% of total impurities (Si, FE, Cu, Cr, or Zn) with high corrosion resistance achieved by a conversion barrier obtained by exposure to a magnesium halogen bath. As a result, a protective coating of magnesium halide, with a thickness in the range of 0.0025 microns to 2 microns, is obtained. This is an application useful for semiconductor applications, where integrated circuits are made by successive deposition and etching techniques, including halogen gases or liquids (chlorine, fluorine, bromine), which are very corrosive for conventional aluminum alloys, even the anodized ones.

**A new invention granted (in force)**

**​**

**Patent granter:** the United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** US 11,110,896 B2

**Title:** *Pulsed laser cleaning of debris accumulated on glass articles in vehicles and photovoltaic assemblies*

**Inventor (s):** Phiroze Dalal

**Applicant (s):** Tesla, Inc.

**Date of patent:** 07.09.2021

**Summary:** Applicants asked for the recognition of the invention of an optic system, including circuitry mounted on the hood of the car (laser windshield wipers), which emit a controlled laser beam able to irradiate a selected area of the windshield, detect present debris by an optical sensor, and remove dirt. The laser beam parameters (wavelength, frequency, spot radius, pulse duration, peak power, angle of incidence, etc.) are controlled to achieve the expected cleanness but avoid any risk of radiation behind the glass or beneath the area of interest. The accepted claims include applications of the invention in other situations as photovoltaic assemblies.

**A requested recognition**

**​**

**Patent granter:** Korean Intellectual Property Office

**Application No.:** 10-2020-0177657

**Title:** *Austenite based steel material for disc brake having excellent strength at high temperature and method of manufacturing*

**Author(s):** Soon-ki Lee, Dong-ho Lee, Sang-deok Kang

**Applicant (s):** POSCO

**Priority date:** 19.12.2019

**Summary:** This claimed invention concerns the design and fabrication of new stainless steel exceptionally functional disk brakes. The key fact is a content of 10 to 25% Mn, up to 8% Cr, and 0.2 to 1.8% C. According to the applicants, this steel shows an excellent high-temperature abrasion resistance. Such behavior is due to the film of precipitates 0.1 to 2.0 μm thick, present at the austenite grain boundaries. As a result, thinner and lighter brake discs can be used.

**​[3D printing to boost exchanger performance](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/engineers-use-3d-printing-technology-to-boost-heat-exchanger-performance-by-2000-196500/)​**

**​**

A team of researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign used 3D printing technology to produce an ultra-compact next-generation heat exchanger, increasing performance by up to 2000%, heat exchangers are simply used to transfer thermal energy from point A to point B. They are essential in most large industries and are present in almost all complex systems that generate heat. This includes power generation systems, transportation, oil and gas processing, water desalination, and thermal management for consumer electronics. Using their 3D design software, the team studied a special type of heat exchanger called a tube-in-tube heat exchanger, which is often found in heat transfer systems, drinking water and building energy systems. With millions of heat exchangers in use around the world today, their performance and efficiency has become more important than ever for global sustainability and reducing energy consumption.

**​[Prevent cathodic corrosion of metal electrodes towards more sustainable processes](https://phys.org/news/2021-09-cathodic-corrosion-metal-electrodes-electroorganic.html)**​

​

Betting for sustainability, a team of researchers from the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany, and the Iowa State University, USA, are working together in order to find how to solve the problem of corrosion of the cathode in a promising application concerning with the electrolysis process for synthesizing valuable chemicals from contaminated soil with plastics. In principle, they are oriented to explore cathode coatings by salts, and corrosion inhibition. Tools are quantum chemistry for calculating the chemical reactions happening, and multi-scale modeling for mapping the movement and concentration of the ions in the catholyte.

**​[Recovery of vanadium from steel slag has increased](https://www.chemengonline.com/vanadium-recovery/?oly_enc_id=6133H9763701C8A)**​

​

A hydrometallurgical process to recover vanadium from slag, a byproduct of steelmaking, has been scaled up significantly. In this demonstration project, vanadium recovery rates exceeded 75% at steady state with over 99.5% vanadium pentoxide purity. The process begins with comminution of the slag, followed by multiple leaching steps using alkaline carbonate process water, resulting in a solid residue that is filtered, repulsed and washed to recover any additional soluble vanadium.
