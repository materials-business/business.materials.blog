**Envisioning the future of galvanized steel**

​

Last week was held GALVATECH 2021, the 12th International Conference on Zinc & Zinc alloy Coated Steel. This event has been held every three years since 1989 and is staged in North America, Europe, and Asia. As usual today, the last meeting was virtual. The organizer was **[ASMET](https://asmet.org/)**, the Austrian Society for Metallurgy and Materials, and it was subtitled “Lighter, Stronger, Durable: Advances in Zn-Coated Steel Sheet.” The next one will behold in Seoul, South Korea, from October 15th to 19th of 2023. In the meantime, ASMET invites the community to attend the “First Galvanizing Highlights Symposium” in Vienna in June 2022.

​\
This year's event featured a panel of plenary lectures focusing on recent developments, challenges, and opportunities for the regions mentioned above. These lectures served as the framework for presenting a series of oral and poster papers showing the more recent development of continuous galvanizing worldwide. Presentations were categorized by subjects, and trends about the business can be deduced from such groups:

​

● The Process: Electrogalvanizing, welding, furnaces (temperature control, rapid cooling, other developments), bath hardware, wettability, dross management, weight control, novel technologies (e.g., hot deep galvanizing), quality control, bath chemistry and management, pot optimization, physical vapor deposition – PVD.

● Applications: Automotive and non-automotive (home appliances and construction).

● Coating properties: microstructure, reactivity, new compositions, weldability.

● New substrates: v.gr., press hardened steel, third-generation advanced high strength steels - 3G steels, and additive-manufactured steel.

● Corrosion behavior: Studies, modeling, coating alloying modification, hydrogen embrittlement.

​\
According to the plenary lectures, some issues must be highlighted regarding the current and expected challenges and opportunities about continuous galvanizing products. At the outset, all problems must be linked to significant challenges facing humanity in the post-globalization era: environment, society, health, and innovation & development. Companies are reacting. They are searching on themes that can be associated with raw materials (scrap availability and cleanliness.), the process itself (reengineering for greener ones), and new and improved coatings (PVD, nano pre-coating, chromium-free, inorganic lubricated, and functional finishes). However, most of the efforts are being put on greener materials for greener mobility. That means lightweight materials (thinner) for the electric car bodies and batteries, but simultaneously giving answers to the challenge of higher crash protection (stronger and higher toughness steels, even for the “uncrachable” self-driven cars of the future) with better manufacturability, better thermal handling, environmental protection (avoiding leakages), and higher corrosion resistance, with products more in line with the requirements of the Circular Economy. As regards market requirements, the tensions are not yet resolved. Mobility should be reduced, but individual transport could increase significantly. On the other hand, the options achieved by the integration of physical/digital is allowing the use of novel tools like big data analysis and other technologies, and solutions are appearing, as shown in GALVATEHC 2021. An interesting comparison between the 2001 and 2021 conferences shows that 20 years ago, efforts were made on topics like Zn-Fe alloys. But now, research is probably more active than before. Some of the current study subjects include other alloys like Zn-Al-Mg, and new substrates, using new tools like simulation and modeling supported on big data and artificial intelligence.

​

Talking about the so-called Advanced High Strength Steels – HHSS, recent developments look for increased mechanical properties, not only in tensile strength but also in elongation, burring, and bendability. For example, POSCO has been moving from products with a minimum tensile strength of 590 MPa to new ones under development with about 2000 MPa. Such substrates are coated with PVD deposited alloys like Zn-Al-3%Mg (Hot or cold rolled) for construction applications and Zn-Al-1.5%Mg (cold rolled) for appliances and automobiles. Outstanding characteristics of these new products include better corrosion resistance, stampability, bonding to other parts (including welding), stone shipping resistance, and anti-perforation properties.

​

**Betting on the industry - academy collaboration**

​\
Much of the progress achieved is related to strong collaboration between industry and academia. In particular, the Japanese experience can be underlined because there is a long history of successful cooperation. Such kind of joined efforts had been led by the Iron and Steel Institute of Japan - ISIJ - in the form of consortia. The first one was established in 1998, and then a series of nine consortia have been developed until now. Some of the universities taking part in these collaborations are Kyoto, Tokyo, Tohoku. General subjects that have been studied are:

​

● Coating microstructure and properties of galvannealed steel sheets.

● Application of galvannealed steel sheets as high-performance materials.

● Effect of Si addition to steel substrate on coating properties of galvannealed steel sheets.

● Formability improvement of the coating layer on galvannealed steel sheets.

● Creation and nanoscale analysis of next-generation hot-dip galvanized steel sheet coatings.

● Formation of excellent hot-dip Zn coating layer and its nano-level analysis.

● Analysis of advanced hot plating film structure and physical properties.

​\
The last consortium, currently under development, is divided into four groups aimed to study:

​

● Oxidation, wettability

● Coating reaction

● Solidification

● Deformability

​\
A group of companies representing ISIJ and 14 universities across the country is in charge of the planned studies. The value of the obtained results looking for closing the gap between behavior into the lab and the actual application is confirmed by the continuity of the active collaboration after almost 25 years of joint efforts. Some of the ground-breaking cooperative results are new and more precise phase diagrams; an accurate crystallographic characterization of the coatings and their relationships with the actual behavior; understanding of the reaction mechanisms happening with new processes and alloys; and understanding the solidification mechanisms occurring with novel coating alloys. The emergence of new substrates in the face of current and future needs has become a new challenge for the galvanization industry and its partner, the academy. Further issues to be studied include reactive wetting, heat treatment of AHSS, and hydrogen embrittlement. In general, there are expected solutions about higher productivity, better quality, improved efficiency, and higher flexibility, looking for minimizing costs and increasing profitability. GALVATECH 2021 has shown that galvanized steel sheet has a promising future supported on the shoulders of a strong community of Corrosionists facing future challenges and opportunities. A future only in the North?

**Wind industry calls for Europe**

**​**

Vessels and maintenance schedules may soon have to be reassessed due to extended shutdowns last year or sudden long waits in overcrowded ports now that global trade has resumed, while ship profiles can change unexpectedly, the painting community can help cut costs in inventive ways, most importantly, fuel and exhaust performance remain at optimum levels whether a vessel is in motion, seated, or experiencing schedule disruptions. Tests have also shown that some new surface coatings and waterline paints resist abrasion and keep decks cool. Fumeless coatings for tight, contained spaces are being developed in Korea, and the trend is moving around the world to other coatings companies, look for software developments from paint companies that will help vessel managers with maintenance and performance efficiencies, thereby avoiding expensive surprises.

**Global success from the beginning**

**​**

In 2014, a small but vibrant tech company invented a way to make top quality PET plastic resin from waste PET plastic and polyester, without making more new plastics, starting in an improvised lab located in a garage, Loop Industries' founders separated polymers in waste PET plastic and polyester fiber into their key components, or monomers, using low energy. In July 2019, Loop used run settings based on the CHEMCAD CC-BATCH module simulation results to run three different distillation stages of Methanol Recovery, Dewatering and MEG Purification. Based on successful pilot results, Loop has created the first documentation on its technology that confirms its suitability to the market. Also, since Loop has a CC-STEADY STATE license, its users can try certain additional functions such as CC-BATCH and CC-THERM to see if the capabilities meet their needs before purchasing.

**Corrosion awareness**

**​**

Bad news last week was concerning the collapse of a 40 years old, 12 stories, residential building in the shore of Miami, USA. Studies about the reasons and culprits of the failure will be developed. Surely, conclusion could give us lessons on how to manage the risk of similar structures in environments like the East coast of Florida. However, corrosion engineers know well the risk of exposure of materials as reinforced concrete to a harsh environment like the above-mentioned. Also, we know how to prevent and control corrosion problems of rebar, including the proper design and materials selection, construction procedures, monitoring measurements, and remediation actions. That means that if the reasons of the tragedy in the USA are related with corrosion, problems could not be associated to a lack of knowledge. They could be a lack of corrosion awareness.
