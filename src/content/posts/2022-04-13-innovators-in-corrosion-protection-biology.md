**Innovators in corrosion protection biology**

​

“Plural” is the keyword of our time, both at the social and the business level. Reality is complex. Also, challenges are not simple, and solutions are better if they are not simple either. Corrosion problems are complex, and most of the time, multidisciplinary solutions are required. Plural points of view are necessary to solve corrosion problems by combining other phenomena further than chemical or electrochemical deterioration processes. This is the case when microbiological processes increase the possibility or magnitude of a corrosion problem. And we talk about microbiological induced corrosion or MIC. Anticorrosive measurements involve biological knowledge, and such a kind of multidisciplinary approach is the best decision. MIC is a common problem in aqueous environments, at temperatures where microorganisms find proper living conditions. Sectors seriously affected by MIC include the O&G industry, the “blue economy” activities, and the drinking water and sewage systems. Knowing about innovations concerning MIC prevention and mitigation is helpful for many Corrosionists. Then, below are curated three examples of inventions that could be inspirational for any of us. An expired patent about an apparatus for monitoring the biofilm behavior and risk. A patent in action concerning a method for fighting biofilm formation on parts and assets handling hydrocarbons. And finally, an asked protection of a model for predicting corrosion pitting in shale gas pipelines due to the incidence of factors like microorganisms.

**Expired exclusivity**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** 5246560A

**Title:** *Apparatus for monitoring biofilm activity*

**Inventor (s):** George Nekoksaand and George J. Licina

**Applicant (s):** Electric Power Research Institute Inc. - EPRI

**Priority date:** 21.11.1991

**Summary:** An invention concerning an electrochemical probe to characterize and monitor the biofilm activity and growth before the beginning of its corrosive effect aimed to optimize the biocides dosage inside aqueous solution pipes. Two closely spaced and identical sets of stainless-steel electrodes are charged, and the AC resistivity of the biofilm is measured. Furthermore, the AC resistance between the electrodes indicates the resistance of the biofilm.

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** 11007554B2

**Title:** *Method, system and device for reducing microbial concentration and/or biofilm formation*

**Inventor (s):** Paul Dabney

**Applicant (s):** Emods Technology LLC

**Date of patent:** 18.05.2021

**Summary:** It is described a low environmental impact procedure taking advantage of the synergistic effect of biocides, chemical oxidant agents such as hydrogen peroxide, urea, carbamide peroxide, or benzoyl peroxide, and radiation to eliminate or reduce the microbial contamination in hydrocarbons, minimizing the biofilm and sludge formation, and the resulting MIC in parts and assets in anaerobic environments of the O&G industry, such as pipes, tanks, and refinery equipment. When oxidizing agents added to the fluid are irradiated, they produce electrically modified oxygen derivatives – EMODs, that reduce or eliminate the biofilm.

​

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** China National Intellectual Property Administration - CNIPA

**Application No.:** 113466406A

**Title:** *Shale gas gathering and transportation trunk line pitting prediction method*

**Author(s):** Zhao Xuefen, Liu Hongji, Hu Baizhong, Huang Cheng, Xu Huanhuan, and Jiang Jiyang

**Applicant (s):** Chongqing University of Science and Technology

**Publication date:** 01.10.2021

**Summary:** The submitted invention is related to a predictive model of corrosion pitting in shale gas pipelines. A model considering the pipeline material and some of the gas and water characteristics included CO2 partial pressure, temperature, pH, and the presence of chlorides, sulfates, carbonic acid, calcium, and magnesium. The model is adjusted with data from experiments performed in a dynamic high-temperature, high-pressure autoclave, considering the presence of microorganisms, the flow regime, and the accumulated liquid and sediments.

**Corrosion awareness by pictures - 2**

Another competition launched as part of the celebration of the next Corrosion Awareness Day is CORROPIC. It is an invitation by the Center for Functional and Surface Functionalized Glass – *[FunGlass](https://www.funglass.eu/)* at the Alexander Dubcek University in Trencin, Slovakia, to *[submit](https://www.funglass.eu/show-your-talent-corropic-photo-competition/)* entitled pictures of corroded materials (glass, metal, concrete, plastic, etc.) in any format. The deadline for submission is April 22 of 2022. The best three pictures will be awarded.

​\
​**Artificial intelligence for anticorrosive tasks is here to stay**

According to *[NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)*, the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the USA, AI technology has become a great opportunity for small and medium enterprises' higher competitiveness. Cost-effective AI solutions are achieving better efficiency and quality, encompassed with lower cost and less downtime. Supported by a report about the advancement of the AI application, there are *[enlisted](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/artificial-intelligence-manufacturing-real-world-success-stories?utm_medium=email&utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_campaign=)* five manufacturing areas of significant financial impact:

* Predictive maintenance
* Predictive quality
* Scrap reduction
* Increasing yield/thruput
* Demand and inventory forecasting

As we can see, all of them are directly or indirectly related to corrosion and anticorrosion duties. In other words, it is a new call to incorporate new technologies into the Corrosionists’ practices, independent of the company size, looking for more sustainable and profitable businesses.
