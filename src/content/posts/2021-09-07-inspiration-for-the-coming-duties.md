description: >-
  This invention aims to increase the resistance to crevice corrosion of
  bi-phasic ferritic/austenitic tungsten stainless steels (3 – 5% wt. W). There
  was developed a surface treatment procedure, including a dipping of the steel
  into a strong acidic (pH <2) or alkaline (pH >10) 3.5% aqueous sodium
  solution, for one week. As a result, the alloying W is oxidized to more stable
  constituents of the passivation layer like WO3 or WO42-.



  In this opportunity, the authors claim to recognize an invention dealing with a methodology for predicting atmospheric corrosion maps based on the amount of corrosion, corrosion rate, and the establishment of complex correlations, including an influential group of topographical and environmental data. According to the inventors, the resulting map is an accurate source of information. It can be used as a tool for long-term corrosion prediction and better materials selection and design. The methodology is illustrated by a flux diagram including a series of the ten steps to follow.

# **Inspiration for the coming duties**

​\
​

Some months ago, this newsletter made a ***[call](https://news.materials.business/13/04/2021/patents-or-bitcoin)*** about considering patents as a subject of the highest interest for Corrosionists in the coming years. An invitation concerning investing great efforts in the patent management at several levels, including use, trade, applying, etc. As scientific and technological papers, patents are relevant documents about the background characterization facing any new challenge and as a source of inspiration for further advancements and innovations. We, in Materials.Business have a permanent compromise about giving a true added-value to the Corrosionists. Consequently, in this opportunity, we are a delight to present to all of you this first edition explicitly devoted to the exploration of expired and in-force patents (mainly recent) and patent applications submitted to patent offices like USPTO in the USA, EPO in Europe, KIPO in South Korea, CNIPA in China, JPO in Japan, and the WIPO globally, as some of the more recognized worldwide.

**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

​**An invention now open for free use (expired)**

**Patent granter:** Korean Intellectual Property Office – KIPO.

**Patent No.:** 100386319 B1

**Title:** *Surface treatment method for improving crevice corrosion resistance of tungsten contained two-phase stainless steel*

**Inventor(s):** Bongwoon Kim, Lee Yong-heon.

**Applicant (s):** POSCO

**Filing date:** 26.12.1996

**Summary:** This invention aims to increase the resistance to crevice corrosion of bi-phasic ferritic/austenitic tungsten stainless steels (3 – 5% wt. W). There was developed a surface treatment procedure, including a dipping of the steel into a strong acidic (pH <2) or alkaline (pH >10) 3.5% aqueous sodium solution, for one week. As a result, the alloying W is oxidized to more stable constituents of the passivation layer like WO3 or WO42-.

**A new invention awarded**

**​**

**Patent granter:** United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO.

**Patent No.:** 11,105,001

**Title:** *Cathodic corrosion protection with solar panel*

**Inventor(s):** Whitmore; David William.

**Applicant(s):** Whitmore; David William.

**Filing date:** 05.09.2017

**Summary:** This invention concerns installing cathodic protection of rebar using a flexible photovoltaic panel attached to the concrete surface as a direct source of electrons to the reinforcing steel bars. The size of the panel is established according to the demanded current and the corresponding required sunlight. Also, a flexible anode is attached at the rear of the panel. In addition, an optional battery can be attached at the panel rear too.

​[Ocean engineers are improving material safety in coastal structures](https://today.tamu.edu/2021/08/03/how-ocean-engineers-are-improving-material-safety-in-coastal-structures/)**​

​

The humid environment of the ocean and coast rich in saline is dangerous for building materials and causes their corrosion and decay over time. As waters rise, coastal structures are at greater risk for the aggressive elements of their ocean home. Although these alloys are not ready for commercial use, they offer a glimpse into the future of offshore engineering, as they combine five elements in almost equal parts to create a material with improved properties. This means two things for engineers involved in ensuring the continued safety of standing coastal and coastal structures: firstly, fundamental assessments are essential and, secondly, critical structures need to be taken out of service.

​

Japan's largest air conditioner manufacturer, Daikin Industries, will halve the amount of copper used in air conditioners from the current 90,000 tons by fiscal year 2024, Nikkei has learned., the international price of copper has risen 40% to 50% last year amid expectations for an economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is currently trading around $9,000 per ton. Daikin has used copper for the heat exchangers in the outdoor air conditioning units. Daikin has focused on the functional advantages of aluminum such as weight reduction and refrigerant reduction. The company has been engaged in the research and development of processing technology for nearly 20 years.
