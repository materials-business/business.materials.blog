# STAINLESS STEEL; A FACT? - PART ll

**A noble family**

Let’s begin by recapping what we talked about in the last article. Steel was **the material** of the 19th Century, and stainless steel – SS - was the “noble,” or somewhat virtuous, the material of the 20th Century. Since its birth in the 1910s, it isn't easy to imagine a day going by without us using some form of SS. From as early as any of us can remember, SS has been in our kitchens and on our dining-tables, in hospitals, at the gym, as urban furniture, architecture, cars, and so on. SS is safe, hygienic (i.e., easy to wash and sterilize- a great trait nowadays!), toxin-free, durable, aesthetically appealing, and easy to maintain. SS is both corrosion resistant and also heat and fire-resistant and is referred to as a heat-resistant alloy. Besides its good mechanical properties, the reasons mentioned above explain its widespread use across major industries dealing with aqueous corrosion. Additionally, SS exhibits good behavior when high-temperature services are required (good oxidation resistance, creep, minor microstructure changes, and erosion-resistant), such as in the energy (nuclear, solar, coal, gas, etc.), chemical, and heavy industry.

​\
​**An overview of the fundamentals of SS**

SS is a group of steels that contain at least 10.5% Cr. This element can be quickly oxidized, creating a regenerative and passivating surface film of Cr2O3, highly adherent, transparent, and thin (2.0-5.0 nm). Usually, a good and protective film on the SS is formed if temperature and corrosive environment are moderated. Some other alloying elements, such as Ni, are often used. According to the percentage of alloying, microstructure and other factors consequently change, thus giving rise to the different properties of SS, categorized by families. The most common categories of SS, according to microstructure at room temperature, are as follows:

​- Austenitic: Contains at least 16% Cr and 6% Ni. The primary type is 304 or 18-8. Type 301 is also widely used.

\- Ferritic: 10.5 to 18% Cr. Grades as 409 and 430 are some examples.

\- Martensitic: Cr is the main alloying-element, but contains a lower percentage than ferritic and a higher C content. Some examples include grades 410, 416, 420, and 440.

\- Duplex: A mixture of austenite and ferrite. Examples are types 2205 and 2304.

\- Precipitation Hardening, PH: Cr-Ni steels can develop very high tensile strengths by the microstructural modification of their martensitic constituent. The typical example is type 630 or 17-4 PH, containing 15-17.5% Cr, 3-5% Ni, and 3-5% Cu.

​When talking about the alloying elements' primary role, we found that Cr forms the passivation film, retarding the inward diffusion of oxygen towards the steel substrate, thus obstructing any further attack. Meanwhile, Ni increases ductility, high-temperature strength, and resistance to Cr2O3 decomposition by carburization or nitridation. SS with Mo content lower than 3% increase creep strength. B also increases creep resistance. Small and controlled amounts of N and C enhance creep strength too. Ti and Nb promote the sigma-phase formation and increase strength in austenitic SS. Small earth metal additions such as cerium or lanthanum significantly improve film adherence, mainly under thermal cycling exposure.

​**SS is not stainless**

​**Breaking the passive film**

Bearing in mind the protection mechanism, SS has limitations when the passivation film either is not well-formed or fails for any reason, the SS then becomes corroded. Like other passivated metals, SS is also prone to corrosion by pitting. This situation frequently happens in conditions with chloride exposure because the small Cl- ion can penetrate the passivation film. The depolarization of a small area on the substrate occurs, and a dissolution process starts. It is a situation where the relationship between cathodic and anodic areas becomes very favorable for a quick penetration attack in a localized point. Then, the rest of the pitting mechanism happens. Such an attack can explain all cases of SS corrosion involving a very aggressive environment. Another problem that concerns the film’s breaking is related to erosive stresses that avoid the passivation, thus allowing the substrate’s exposure to a permanent attack by the corrosive environment. In the end, a simultaneous effect of corrosion and mechanical efforts results in a problem of corrosion/erosion.

​**Sensitizing**

Another risk appears when some microstructure regions become depleted in Cr due to factors such as high-temperature diffusion and reactions with C or N that form carbides or nitrides. The affected region of the SS becomes “sensitized,” and corrosion subsequently happens. Such occurrences related to the SS behavior at high temperatures become common when SS is welded without following recommended practices and the neighbor region turns depleted on Cr. Therefore, SS welding has become a severe matter of concern and is a topic of intensive research. In most cases, there are solutions. For example, corrosion resistance at temperatures as high as 1000 °C can be achieved with Cr contents between 25 and 30%, while carburization can be limited using extra-low C contents (grades “L”) or higher Ni concentrations.

​**Stress Corrosion Cracking**

Sometimes, SCC happens, where one of the inductors is the chloride ion, but the starting condition is related to local residual stresses into the SS. Here, duplex SS shows better behavior resisting corrosive attack and supporting SCC better due to its mixture of ferrite and austenite. This mixture allows the avoidance of the crack’s propagation after its initiation. Sometimes, heat treatment is a suitable solution, too.

Conditions like a crevice, other concentration cell possibilities, or galvanic couples are additional risks for SS corrosion. Taking additional anticorrosive measures is useful more of the time. The starting point usually is a proper design and selection of materials. Then, counter measurement technologies like **[cathodic protection](https://doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2014.939499)**, **[hardening](https://www.expanite.com/)**, and **[special coatings](https://www.kloecknermetalsuk.com/latest-news/product-spotlight-colour-stainless-steel/)**, which have been developed in the last 3-4 decades, are then applied accordingly. And finally, to have a real stainless-steel means to have adequate training in executing the right project design, choosing the suitable material for the desired application, and how to use and care for the SS. All of these are crucial steps for “well-behaving” SS, particularly for critical conditions.

**Occurring developments**

**Products**

Looking for a ‘better behaving’ SS, researchers in companies and academics are hard at work in increasingly demanding service conditions. Regarding the market, we found new products like Sanicro® 35. According to the **[manufacturer](http://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2564464/078AECFE4E30482A3E3DF3235F3E17EB)**, it is an alloy with a nominal composition of 35% Ni, 27% Cr, 6.5% Mo, 0.8% Mn, 0.3% N, 0.2% Cu, and ≤0.05% Si, ≤0.030% C, ≤0.030% P, ≤0.020% S. The resulting SS grade is characterized by its good behavior in conditions under risk of pitting and crevice corrosion, SCC, high acidic and caustic environments, erosion, and increased mechanical efforts. Products like the above come from past research, most of the time reported as patents or papers. The following point is just one example of the efforts that have been done over the last decades, confirming that although SS is ‘old’ material, it still has a bright future.

​\
​**Inventions**

A quick search in the US Patent Office database, USPTO, shows some impressive figures. Using the keywords such as “stainless” and “steel,” the total number of granted patents since the year 1790 (when the first USA Patent Act was established) is currently sitting at 1717. Between 1976 and now, 1597 patents have been awarded, with the latest one granted on February the 2nd, 2021. That means only 120 patents about SS were granted before 1976. Furthermore, when looking at these patents’ subjects, it is easy to identify that the inventions during the last decades are mainly related to new: alloys, products, processes, and applications in an exciting approach to the emerging technologies. To give an idea about the novelty of these patents, the following are the summaries of some of them (where some of the points of interest are in **bold**):

​**\-Patent: “***Austenitic stainless-steel sheet for exhaust component having excellent heat resistance and workability, turbocharger component, and method for producing austenitic stainless-steel sheet for exhaust component*.”

**\- Patent:** “*Ferritic stainless-steel foil.*”

**\- Patent**:“*Stainless steel substrate.*”

​Additionally, looking at the applications over the last 20 years shows a list of 1408 submitted patents, where the latest one was submitted on February 4th, 2021. Some of the latest applications include (where the points of interest are in **bold**):

**\- Application**: “*Ferritic stainless steel*.”\
​**\- Application**: “*New duplex stainless steel.*”

**\- Application**: “*Stainless Steel Powder for Producing a Shaped Article*.”\
Behind the upcoming and future patents and products on the market, much more research is needed before. What are researching now and what issues must be investigated are themes of interest thinking about the future of SS. Right now is the perfect time to go more in-depth on this topic.
