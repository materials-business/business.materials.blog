# **A TOP-NOTCH BURIAL FOR OUR ASSETS.**

**Valuable infrastructure at risk**

​Since the cavemen times, underground housing and urban infrastructure options have been used to provide better safety conditions, work requirements, or as a cover against extreme weather. In lots of cases, structures and equipment are often underground. Currently, our civilization runs on a dense network of pipes under the ground across the globe, supplying our hands with water and fuels. Although these buried structures and equipment are out of sight, they play a critical role, mainly in sectors like utilities and O&G and mining and other industries that construct things like tunnels, towers, poles, buildings, etc. According to a **[Colombian study](http://bibliotecadigital.udea.edu.co/bitstream/10495/6014/1/ArroyaveCarlos_1999_ProblemasCorrosionRelacion.pdf)** illustrating the magnitude of corrosion problems in the country, 17% of companies were affected by corrosion in soils.

This situation is not uncommon and follows similar global patterns, as pipes are the most buried assets worldwide, by far. **[For](https://www.aboutpipelines.com/en/pipeline-101/pipeline-history/)** **​[instance](https://www.aboutpipelines.com/en/pipeline-101/pipeline-history/)**, in Canada, the first transmission pipeline was built in 1853, and right now, the national network is made up of more than 119.000 km of underground transmission lines (three times more pipelines than highways).

​A list of the world’s longest pipelines **[includes](https://www.offshore-technology.com/features/worlds-longest-pipelines/)**:

​● West-East Gas Pipeline, 8.707 km. Phase I connects the Tarim Basin gas fields in Xianjing to Shanghai, China, stretching 4.000km. Furthermore, it consists of eight branches, reaching 66 cities in ten provinces. Phase I cost USD 5.700 million and holds up to 17.000 million m³. Phases II and III each hold 30.000 million m³.

● Druzhba Pipeline, 5.500 km. Druzhba has been operating since 1964 and runs from Almetyevsk in Samara, central Russia, to Schwedt in northern Germany with its north branch, and Hungary with the southern one. Construction of the pipeline costs around USD $5.92 million and **[consists of nearly 1.300.000 tons of pipe,](https://mero.cz/en/druzba/)​** **[99% underground, and](https://mero.cz/en/druzba/)** **​[is buried roughly 1.3 m below the earth’s surface](https://mero.cz/en/druzba/)**. It has a capacity of up to 2 million barrels of oil per day.

● Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean Oil Pipeline – ESPOOP, 4.857 km. This pipeline connects the town of Taishet in the Irkutsk oblast in central Siberia to Kozmino on the eastern Siberian coast. It consists of a branch that connects them to the Skovorodino refinery and port near the northern Chinese border. Its current capacity is 36.7 million tons of crude oil per year.

● Yamal – Europe, 4.196 km. It is considered the world’s widest pipeline, connecting the natural gas fields in the Yamal peninsula in Russia to Germany and Austria. Regarded as the world’s widest pipeline, it has a 1.42 m can transport 33.000 million m³ per year.

​As in the Keystone project mentioned above, other than economic and technical issues, environmental and political factors are the biggest concerns. This is the situation with the Nord Stream, a system of on-and-offshore natural gas pipelines connecting Russia and Central Europe through the Baltic Sea (the longest sub-sea pipeline globally), with a yearly capacity of 110.000 million m³ of gas. **[According to the schedule, phase II, the first of the two branches, will be completed in the current semester](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/nord-stream-2-plans-to-finish-bulk-of-work-on-one-line-in-june)**. Similarly, some other planned pipelines under consideration, such as the Trans- Saharan Pipeline, connecting Nigerian O&G sources with the Hassi R’Mel gas fields in Northern Algeria, is designed to be 4.127 km long. The proposed East African Crude Oil Pipeline, 1.445 km long, will be used to transport oil from Uganda to a Tanzanian port on the Indian Ocean. And lastly, the National Unification Gas Pipeline -GASUN, 4.989 km long, will connect Bolivia’s reserves in the Rio Grande region to Porto Alegre on Brazil’s southeast coast and crossing Northern (Amazon) and Northeast Brazilian states too.

​**A practical and ethical resistance**

​Many of these buried structures are often left to their own devices. There are practical reasons for this because usually, it is difficult to check and maintain them. Corrosionists can generally predict what could happen. So appropriate materials selection, proper design, protection measurements, and inspection practices are usually implemented beforehand to reduce these corrosive environments’ impact. However, inspections and interventions are not possible in many cases, so materials protection becomes very limited. Furthermore, simply burying these assets in a trench is not so much as to hide it as is the point of other buried items (i.e., treasure) in the history of man and animals. It is, of course, an issue of sound engineering principles; it is an ethical duty both for companies and engineers. Buried assets are hard to protect, but they must not be forgotten, and neither should corrosion problems be buried. This is a severe ethical subject that must always be kept in mind, where duties start with proper handling of underground corrosion basics.

**A complex corrosive environment**

​We know that water is the universal corrosive agent and that natural environments are corrosive for thermodynamic reasons. Water itself, air, and earth, too, are all natural corrosives. All three are essential for life and human development. Air is what we breathe and is one source of the energy we need (think back to our bodies’ metabolic reactions). The land (i.e., earth) has been the conventional factor of essential product generation. Water is omnipresent, and it permeates air and soil; it is the “greater treasure,” and nowadays is priming to be an issue of business at the New York stock exchange. Now for this next part, let’s recap some of the basics of soil corrosion. In principle, the established electrochemical corrosion cell is simple: the material at risk acts as a cathode and the water in the corrosive soil as the electrolyte. And the corrosion trend is closely related to the homogeneity degree of the system. As usual, the point of anticorrosive measures is to either break or modify that cell. Of course, the nature of the asset’s material is relevant; for example, other than just the composition, the homogeneity of the surface at the macro and micro levels can influence the establishment of macro galvanic cells, or localized dissolution and pitting appearance due to non-metallic inclusions. Other characteristics concern the assets’ interaction mode due to the regular long-time exposure (i.e., many decades) in these corrosive environments. However, most of the complexity of corrosion problems' comes from the soil’s traits and its variable heterogeneity. Corrosion rates are non-linear, and the problem is multivariate. Additionally, we found limitations for its study because of the unavoidable alterations during the intervention. From this point of view, we can discuss the following three kinds of soil factors that influence the corrosion of buried assets, most of them are interconnected:

● Physical-chemical: This involves weathering factors, aeration level (including atmospheric gases like O₂, CO₂, H₂S, and nitrogen and sulfur oxides), water content (including extreme situations as mud and permafrost, and variability of the water table), pH (where **[mineralogical composition plays a remarkable role](https://doi.org/10.5006/2748)**), **[texture](https://doi.org/10.5006/3515)** (i.e., the ratio between sand, silt plus clay), soluble salts, resistivity, redox potential, and **[magnetic fields](about:blank)** and their anomalies.

● Microbiological: Here, we need to mention three kinds of microorganisms. The first one has a direct effect on the corrosion cell reactions (e.g., the sulfate-reducing Bacterium *Desulfovibrio desulfuricans*); the second microorganisms affect organic protective coatings (e.g., cellulolytic bacteria, able to deteriorate some kinds of cellulosic coatings), and lastly, the third microorganisms produce corrosive substances (e.g., *Thiobacillus thiooxidans*, generating H₂SO₄ as a byproduct of its growth).

● Operational: This includes galvanic pairs (accidental or not, even kilometers wide), stray currents (unsuspected most of the times), burial depth, accidental intervention on the buried asset, and contamination (e.g., fertilizer, accidental spills, but also industrial wastes, including nuclear; moreover the increasing risk of deposits of atmospheric pollutants like the **[underground CO](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum_boosting-carbon-intake-from-50-to-4000-tonnes-activity-6777229391287136256-Plqy)₂** **[storage technologies that have been proposed currently](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum_boosting-carbon-intake-from-50-to-4000-tonnes-activity-6777229391287136256-Plqy)**).

​Consequences of the corrosive attacks by soil include generalized corrosion and the pitting mentioned above. But due to the cited factors, the galvanic attack is typical, and concentration cells often happen. Thus, crevice corrosion becomes another common mechanism of asset deterioration. Furthermore, stress corrosion cracking is usually found, and sometimes the dealloying mechanism of attack also appears. In these cases, it is mainly cast iron pipes with free graphite as a microstructural constituent that are prone to such phenomenon, undergoing the so-called graphitic corrosion.

​**What we can do**

​Management and handling of soil corrosion have received a more hands-on approach than other corrosion fields. One of the most studied engineering rules is corrosiveness prediction from one or more parameters and concluding how high the corrosion attack risk is. The soil's electrical resistivity has broadly been used as this property is directly related to the electrolyte effectivity. Other people prefer to use the redox potential as a good indicator of the corrosion risk. Likewise, a combination of the soil characteristics, including resistivity, redox potential, water content, pH, and concentration of ions such as chlorides, sulfites, and sulfates, are applied for predicting the behavior. However, such an empirical approach is hazardous, and one way of avoiding this is to follow standardized practices. Consequently, technical and operational handling of underground assets is extensively standardized (for example, the Canadian pipeline standards document is over 500 pages).

Standards and other scientific and engineering criteria are a valid starting point for a corrosion prevention practice, and this is a great responsibility from the very beginning of any project. Simple but powerful methods include heterogeneities prevention, thus making homogeneous beds essential. Sometimes, concerning unique beds, looking for homogeneous and less corrosive environments is necessary to avoid galvanic couples and stray currents and is critical in the design stage and service life. Conventional anticorrosive methods must be considered as part of the design, too. This could be using barriers between the asset and the soil through jackets, plastic films, protective coatings, and paint systems. The inversion of the corrosion cell by cathodic protection is another robust and well-developed method. A protective coating is often complemented with cathodic protection. It is also necessary to select either no metallic assets or avoid burying them and put them above ground.

Another duty concerning buried assets is inspection. In the case of pipelines, advances in tools for the inspection inside the pipes have been significant. Right now, the so-called “pigs” or “hedgehogs” are broadly used in many cases. Here, technologies such as artificial vision, data analytics, and unmanned robotics are being combined, and technicians can follow the conditions inside the entire pipeline online. Of course, there are limitations concerning diameters, geometries, handled substances, and so on. Although, such kinds of tools cannot as well inspect the state outside.

**Outstanding issues**

The need further than the spirit of exploration, colonization, and innovation instinctive to humans forces us to imagine that we will significantly increase subsoil use shortly. In addition, the soil environment’s complexity is a true challenge for corrosion engineers and a physical barrier for inspection, maintenance, and repair. In conclusion, there are more than enough reasons to consider the importance of taking advantage of the emerging technologies for a deeper scientific understanding and management of buried assets’ integrity. For example, we have a Ph.D. thesis **[modeling the soil’s resistivity and pH in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina](https://digital.cic.gba.gob.ar/handle/11746/5622)**. Still, such studies are few and usually restricted to relatively small areas because of practical limitations. Fortunately, researchers have started to approach the problems of corrosion by soils using new technologies. To positively highlight this, **[a recent paper](https://onepetro.org/NACECORR/proceedings-abstract/CORR19/All-CORR19/NACE-2019-13456/127477)** talks about estimating the corrosion growth rate for the underground pipelines, using tools like data analytics, neural networks, geospatial positioning, and, in conclusion, integrating machine learning and geographical information systems (GIS). Undeniably, taking advantage of these new tools and others (e.g., nanotechnology, sensorics, robotics, biomimetic, and augmented reality) will pave the route to find solutions as monitoring techniques, self-made maintenance, self-repairing materials, and so on.

**Barriers are opportunities**

Concerns about sustainability led to campaigns like the “**[coalition of European organizations pushing for system change around repair](https://repair.eu/about/)**.” According to this organization, e-waste is the fastest growing waste stream globally, 53 million tons per year, and only 15-20% is recycled. Under such kind of pressure, and in agreement with the EU Circular Economy guidelines, last October the European Parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) Committee approved a rule obligating companies that sell appliances and gadgets to ensure those apparatus can be repaired for up to 10 years under the **["right to repair,"](https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/01/eu-law-requires-companies-to-fix-electronic-goods-for-up-to-10-years)** law. In the same way, some USA states have introduced some rights to repair bills in their legislatures. Also, Sweden has decided to lower the value-added tax on repairs and spare parts.

​**Sharing experience on innovation**

By definition, innovation means success. To know about the innovative experience of successful enterprises pays, just as a benchmarking exercise or a learning opportunity. For this reason, it is good to know that Huawei has launched the White Paper “Respecting and Protecting Intellectual Property: The Foundation of Innovation.” In this document, the company presents a history of spending 30 years devoted to investing over 10% of its annual revenue on R&D and converting a small unknown enterprise into a global one. Innovation that the company says is supported by respecting and protecting intellectual property. That means a compromise with patenting and taking part in the international licensing business, selling and buying highlighted knowledge.
