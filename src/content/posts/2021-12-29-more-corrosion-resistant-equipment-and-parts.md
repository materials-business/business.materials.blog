description: Patenting activity is a direct measurement of the culture of
  innovation. According to the figures, the ten most innovative countries by
  patents granted per capita are Taiwan, Israel, United States, South Korea,
  Japan, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. As we have
  mentioned before, the Japan Patent Office is one of the outstanding national
  centers of patenting worldwide. This is closely linked to Japan's culture of
  innovation and its post-World War II industrial development. To look at
  Japanese inventions is interesting for any Corrosionist. Then, the following
  are three expired patents that could be useful for solving problems anywhere
  or inspiring related solutions facing the current challenges concerning the
  handling of corrosive substances associated with the present and coming
  industrial processes. The first patent is about a high corrosion-resistant
  stainless steel for applications like chimneys. The second one relates to a
  special metal coating to catalyze a proper oxygen/hydrogen balance, thus
  controlling the aggressiveness of low aerated water flowing inside pipes. In
  the end, it is reported an invention about a polymeric/ceramic composite
  coating particularly resistant to aggressive electrolytes like copper refining
  baths. Further than the coating, the patent includes a unique geometry of the
  Cu refining container. It is worth remembering that they are patents that have
  already expired. Therefore, all three are free for any use, including economic
  exploitation.

​

Patenting activity is a direct measurement of the culture of innovation. According to the ***[figures](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-10-most-innovative-countries-in-the-world/)***, the ten most innovative countries by patents granted per capita are Taiwan, Israel, United States, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. As we have mentioned ***[before](https://news.materials.business/03/11/2021/a-highway-to-the-richness)***, the Japan Patent Office is one of the outstanding national centers of patenting worldwide. This is closely linked to Japan's culture of innovation and its post-World War II industrial development.To look at Japanese inventions is interesting for any Corrosionist. Then, the following are three expired patents that could be useful for solving problems anywhere or inspiring related solutions facing the current challenges concerning the handling of corrosive substances associated with the present and coming industrial processes.

**Patent granter:** Japan Patent Office – JPO

**Patent No.:** 02170946

**Title:** *High alloy stainless steel for chimney, flue and desulfurizing equipment having excellent corrosion resistance*

**Inventor (s):** Akira Matsuhashi, Eiji Sato, Masayuki Abe, Hideo Anpo, Takeji Matsumoto, Ryuichiro Ebara, and Ideo Nakamoto.

**Applicant (s):** Nippon Steel Corp. & Mitsubishi Heavy Ind. Ltd.

**Expiration date:** 23.12.2008

**Summary:** It is a patent referring to the formulation of stainless steel having high resistance to general and crevice corrosion in environments like chimneys desulfurization equipment. Key fact is a minimum addition of alloying elements by regulating its compositional critical value. The claimed composition contains 0.004 to 0.05% C, ≤5% Si, ≤2% Mn, 18 to 25% Cr, 14 to 24% Ni, 1 to 4.5% Mo, 0.5 to 2.0% Cu, ≤2% W, ≤1% Nb, ≤0.5% V, ≤1%Ti, ≤1% Zr, ≤0.1% Sn, ≤0.05% Al and 0.01 to 0.3% N, ≤0.03% P, 0.001 to 0.03 % (Ca + Ce), ≤100ppm S, ≤50ppm O, and a mathematical inter regulation of the several alloying elements.

**Patent granter:** Japan Patent Office – JPO

**Patent No.:** 05195266

**Title:** *Method for reducing flow-assisted corrosion of carbon steel components.*

**Inventor (s):** Young Jin Kim and Leonard W Niedrach

**Applicant (s):** General Electric Co.

**Expiration date:** 31.07.2012

**Summary:** This procedure is addressed to control the corrosive attack of carbon steel pipelines transporting low-oxygen water. For this purpose, a thin coating of the platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Os, Ru, Ir, and Rh) is deposited on the steel. This coating acts as a catalyzer of the water splitting. The ratio of hydrogen vs. oxygen, in ppb, is maintained about 1:8 or more, and the water becomes less aggressive to the steel substrate.

**Patent granter:** Japan Patent Office – JPO

**Patent No.:** 05195277

**Title:** *Container for corrosive-resistant material*

**Inventor (s):** John O. Harry and George Verhagen

**Applicant (s):** Corrosion Technology Inc.

**Expiration date:** 13.06.2011

**Summary:** This invention concerns constructing a highly corrosion-resistant container for corrosive electrolytes such as metal refining baths. It is a vessel with a unique geometry, including walls covered with a cured polymer concrete shell. The special coating is applied using a unique process, which is also described. This coating is a composite consisting of a polymeric matrix of a thermosetting vinyl ester and polyester resin, impregnating about 20% to 30% by weight of fiberglass mat reinforcement.

**​**

The ingredient in question is a cleverly chosen liquid, which is any of several gallium alloys that melt below room temperature, this causes a pressure difference in the area of ​​the metal deep enough to attract the reactants, allowing the donation of electrons and the desired chemical reaction. The laws of physics determine where these liquid metal machines are most efficient. This means that liquid metals engineering will be more efficient for a few inches or smaller objects.
