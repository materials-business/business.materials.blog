Electricity transmission lines are a relevant part of the infrastructure essential for modern life, at risk of atmospheric deterioration. As a result, the direct and indirect costs of preventing and remediating corrosion problems in transmission lines reach millions of dollars yearly. Often, these costs are charged on the bill of the final consumer. Other times, the issues are so significant that the own existence of electricity companies is put at risk. The innovation about avoiding corrosion risks and diminishing the associated cost pays. Below are curated three examples of technological developments concerning anticorrosive measurements for the corrosion prevention of power transmission lines. Three different roots (Japan, Italy, and the USA), three different moments (the 1970s, 2010s, and 2020s), three different statuses (expired, in-force, and asked).

**Expired exclusivity**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** 4,042,969

**Title:** *Electric cable power transmission lines*

**Inventor (s):** Teruji Nikaido, Kaoru Haga, and Yasutaka Fujiwara

**Applicant (s):** Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc SWCC Shova Holdings Co Ltd

**Priority date:** 26.06.1975

**Summary:** Inventors achieved a solution for reducing the corrosion risk and other improvements in electric cable power transmission lines of the type utilizing the cross-connecting system. The invention deals with an arrangement of circuits interconnecting specific transmission line components, upgrading its performance, and lowering the cost of installation and maintenance.

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** European Patent Office - EPO

**Patent No.:** 2766965B1

**Title:** *Electrical power transmission line comprising a corrosion-protected raceway and method of protecting a raceway from corrosion*

**Inventor (s):** Paolo Maioli, Rodolfo Sica, and Pietro Anelli

**Applicant (s):** Prysmian SpA

**Date of patent:** 08.07.2020

**Summary:** This innovation concerns an alkaline passivating wet material filling the raceway and embedding the housed electrical power transmission lines. It is a water-swellable and expansible superabsorbent polymeric porous material impregnated with an alkaline aqueous solution. Such a filling passivates metal surfaces in touch. In addition, it avoids oxygen, water, or salt presence inside the raceway, minimizing the risk of corrosion by concentration cells, e.g., crevice and other attack mechanisms. Finally, both the cage and the transmission line become protected against corrosive attack.

​

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Application No.:** 20210172858

**Title:** *Infrastructure Corrosion Analysis*

**Author(s):** Mark A. Gluskin, Kevin C. Garrity, Christopher M. Warner, Alan Eastman, and Mark Reiboldt

**Applicant (s):** Quanta Associates LP

**Priority date:** 10.06.2021

**Summary:** The reported novelty is related to a holistic approach towards the data capturing, assessment, diagnosis, and establishment of the maintenance plan of power transmission lines and similar infrastructure systems by simultaneous use of hardware and software linked to emerging technologies such as sensorics, dronics, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

**Emerging tool to improve asset management**

Inspecting extensive facilities like buildings and industrial plants in the energy, telecommunications, construction, bridges, and real estate sectors is challenging. Usually, logistics is not easy, and such a duty is expensive and highly time demanding. *[Drone Harmony](https://droneharmony.com/)* and *[FlyNex](https://www.flynex.io/)* are currently joining their specialties, looking to conduct*[ data retrieval processes with drones](https://droneharmony.com/drone-harmony-and-flynex/)*. Drone Harmony focuses on the three-dimensional data collecting process for robotic missions. In addition, FlyNex is integrating the workflow of planning drone operations, integrating devices, teams, and projects, and connecting third-party solutions for data analysis. By that, FlyNex and Drone Harmony allow an integrated 3D mission planning in a scalable cloud-based drone management platform.

**Achieving an alchemist's dream**

Strong and light materials are ideal for all, and their obtention has been an enduring dream for materials engineers. A recent advance in such a goal has been announced by a team of researchers from MIT, the Army Research Lab., and Harvard University in the USA. According to their *[repor](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04296-3)*t, they have synthesized a film for applications like barrier coatings, which is chemically stable highly processable, with an elastic modulus and yield strength of 12.7 ± 3.8 gigapascals and 488 ± 57 megapascals, respectively. “A new material that is stronger than steel and as light as plastic.”

# Networking & Knowledge Exchange

​

**Better passivation films**

Virtual. The next talk of the CorroZoom series hosted by the Fontana Corrosion Center at the Ohio State University, USA, will be given by Karl Sieradzki from Arizona State. The speech will be related with “Percolation, chemical short-range order and passivation.” Prof. Sieradzki will present the latest version of his model about passivity. This model is supported by the percolation theory and the concept of chemical short-range order in alloys. Results for modeling aqueous passivation of Fe-Cr, Ni-Cr, and Cu-Rh alloys are presented, showing how such kinds of alloys can form excellent protective passive films with the ability to self-heal with little metal dissolution.

**Date:** Tuesday, February 22, 2022.

**Time:** 08:00 EST (GMT – 5)
