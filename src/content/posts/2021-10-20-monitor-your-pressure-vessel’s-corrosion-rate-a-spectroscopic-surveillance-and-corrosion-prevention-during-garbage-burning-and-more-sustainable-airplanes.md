  Patent granter: Japan Patent Office – JPO


  Patent No.: JP20190016804


  Title: Anti-corrosion equipment and method


  Inventor (s): Kazuya Yokoyama and Terunobu Nakajyo


  Applicant (s): Sumitomo Heavy Industries


  Date of patent: 05.09.2017


  Summary: The seven claims admitted are related to an apparatus to be used for the assessment of any risk of attack and the prevention of the corrosion problems in boilers employed for energy generation by combustion of waste (construction wood-based materials, tires, and plastics) containing large amounts of impurities like alkali components such as Na and K, and biomass fuels. Consequently, there is a risk of corrosion by alkali, salt generated by the combustion. The principle for the risk assessment is associated with the measurement of the differences in absorbance or transmittance between the irradiated light from a burning object and of the fuel. In addition, the apparatus contains a corrosion inhibitor controlled supply source, operating in accordance with the irradiation values measured.

  Title: Methods of protecting metallic components against corrosion using chromium-containing thin films


  Author (s): Thomas Knisley, Mark Saly, David Alexander Britz, and David Thompson


  Applicant (s): Applied Materials, Inc.


  Filing date: 26.05.2021


  Summary: There was developed an anticorrosive protective film for aerospace parts, based on a combination of chromium compounds: metallic, oxide, nitride, carbide, and silicide. Atomic Layer Deposition – ALD - coating procedure includes the active chromium compounds precursor and a reactant to form the protective nanolayer via chemical vapor deposition – CVP of less than 10 µm thick. Substrates are diverse and include Ni, Al, Cr, Fe, Ti, Hf, and their alloys. Sequentially deposited nanofilms, forming a stack of similar or different layers is an option. Some of the chromium precursors can be bis (cyclopentadiene), bis (pentamethylcyclopentadiene), bis (isopropylcyclopentadiene), bis (ethylbenzene), hexacarbonyl, acetylacetonate, hexafluoroacetylacetonate, diazadienyl, and their derivatives. Reactants could be oxidizing agents like water, oxygen, ozone, nitrous oxide, peroxide, or alcohol. Alternative nanolayers also include other compounds of Al, Si, Y, Hf, and Ti.

# **From The Editor's Corner**



# **Monitor your pressure vessel’s corrosion rate; a spectroscopic surveillance and corrosion prevention during garbage burning; and more sustainable airplanes**

​

​\
​This week, we discovered three inspiring new patents to share with our colleagues to maintain and elevate interest in new knowledge, further research, technology development, and, eventually, new products and services achieved in the corrosion and anticorrosion engineering market.

​\
​

**How to how to beware with your tank.** A recently expired patent from Japan addresses a practical problem for most Corrosionists. This is the case of internal corrosion of tank walls supporting corrosive conditions. With the invented device is possible to follow the corrosion’s progression with time and determine the tank’s useful life, not by calculations, but for actual measurements instead—a procedure independent of the material, geometry, and operating conditions. In the end, a methodology for optimizing designs and avoiding overestimations, overruns, and safety risks.

​\
​

**Prevention and control of corrosion risk in trash burners.** These days, with the need to develop options for fossil fuels, there are opportunities such as burning biomass and polymer waste. A non-conventional process with novel problems included managing corrosion problems—difficulties concerning high-temperature processes, including uncontrolled, usually highly contaminated raw materials. A few years ago, it had been awarded a patent of equipment combining the measurement of the corrosiveness of the generated gases and the possibility of adding a corrosion inhibitor according to the measured risk.

​\
​**Anticorrosive nanofilms for lighter airplanes**. A new application for a patent relates to a more sustainable protective coating for aerospace components. The proposed coating is a stack of one or more nanolayers of complex composition, including some of the passivable elements, covering different common substrates in the sector. Thinner coatings with better protection mean lighter and longer -life aircraft for a more sustainable aerospace industry.

\
​**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

**Patent granter:** Japan Patent Office – JPO

**Patent No.:** JP2000019098

**Title:** *Tank corrosion-detecting device*

**Author (s):** Kamegawa Masayasu

**Applicant (s):** Kamegawa Masayasu

**Priority date:** 21.01.2000

**Summary:** A registered invention concerning a device of the same material as the tank, mounted to a tank wall, acting as a corrosion gauge. The corrosion rate in actual conditions is followed periodically, and span life is determined before any risk of failure by a corrosive attack by liquids, gases, or powders, and any other simultaneous loads stressing the structure. Also, it is a monitoring tool independent of the regime changes during operation. The registered patent presents a complete description of the invented device, including relevant mathematical calculations.

​***[Groupe Seb](https://www.groupeseb.com/en)***, is a large French consortium that produces small appliances, and it’s the world’s largest manufacturer of cookware. Groupe Seb Andean is the owner of IMUSA, a metallurgical plant located close to Medellin, Colombia. IMUSA has installed the first solar farm in the metallurgical sector in Colombia in collaboration with Green Yellow, an alternative energy facility provider. Paul de Jarnac, President of Groupe Seb Andean, believed that the commitment to generate solar energy also enables Colombian homes to achieve products developed with a trace of sustainability, which also directly benefits the company’s 1,360 employees. “Economic reactivation is used in the energy transition. All transitional public policies, which provide fiscal, trade and regulatory incentives, allow companies like Groupe Seb to contribute to the country’s reactivation,” said the Colombian Mining and Energy Minister.

​

Researchers at ***[Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/)***, U.K., have developed a new hybrid 3D printing technique that allows printed parts to change their properties over time, providing a new form of 4D printing. The Materials Processing Extrusion Additive Manufacturin approach combines traditional extrusion-based 3D printing with chemical processing by immersion in acetone. As a result, mechanical and geometrical properties can be tailored, and new functionalities of the materials are achieved. Further than mechanical and geometric properties, could be improved through similar hybrid 3D processes, included doped materials with a dosed release of inhibitors, anticorrosive behavior according to the moment’s requirements, etc.

**​*[T&T Group](https://www.ttgroup.com.vn/)*** from Vietnam, and the Danish company ***[Ørsted](https://orsted.com/)***, have signed a MOU to develop a collaboration on offshore wind in Vietnam. The two groups will use their experience and capacities to fully reveal the strengths and capabilities of each party to bring positive impact to projects, while also contributing to the promotion and development of adequate infrastructure, supply chain and formation. In addition to this world-class potential, Vietnam’s rapidly increasing electricity demand means there will be an urgent need for new large-scale reliable power supplies in the coming decades. These factors, combined with Vietnam’s strong supply chain potential, convinced Ørsted and T&T Group that offshore wind plays a central role in Vietnam’s future energy structure.
