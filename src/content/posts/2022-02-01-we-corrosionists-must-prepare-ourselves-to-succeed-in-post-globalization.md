description: In a recent post, Dr. Leonardo Bertolucci Coelho, Postdoctoral
  Researcher at Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, invites Corrosionists to
  discuss his paper recently published in npj materials degradation, entitled
  “Reviewing machine learning of corrosion prediction in a data-oriented
  perspective.” In his call, Bertolucci mentions the accelerated growth of
  Artificial Intelligence – AI – and Machine Learning – ML applications. This is
  a pivotal point to keep in mind because the opportunities will disappear fast.
  It is important to remember that the First Industrial Revolution – IR - lasted
  for almost two centuries, but the second was less than 70 years, and the last
  third was just about 40 years. Quickly, we are speaking of a window of ten, a
  maximum of 20 years ahead, to become successful Corrosionists in integrating
  the physical and virtual worlds, which is the main characteristic of the
  current IR.

In a recent *[post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/leonardo-bertolucci-coelho-26bb78121_reviewing-machine-learning-of-corrosion-prediction-activity-6892071540096069632-0Qsv)*, Dr. Leonardo Bertolucci Coelho, Postdoctoral Researcher at Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, invites Corrosionists to discuss his paper recently published in *[npj materials degradation](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41529-022-00218-4)*, entitled “Reviewing machine learning of corrosion prediction in a data-oriented perspective.” His is an article co-authored with our colleagues Professor Herman Terryn and Dr. Yves Van Ingelgem of the Research Group Electrochemical and Surface Engineering Department of Materials and Chemistry, at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel - VUB, Belgium, and Professor Dawei Zhang, of the University of Science and Technology Beijing. The multi-disciplinary contribution was achieved by Professor Ann Nowé and Dr. Denis Steckelmacher of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the VUB.

In his call, Bertolucci mentions the accelerated growth of Artificial Intelligence – AI – and Machine Learning – ML applications. This is a pivotal point to keep in mind because the opportunities will disappear fast. It is important to remember that the First Industrial Revolution – IR - lasted for almost two centuries, but the second was less than 70 years, and the last third was just about 40 years. Quickly, we are speaking of a window of ten, a maximum of 20 years ahead, to become successful Corrosionists in integrating the physical and virtual worlds, which is the main characteristic of the current IR.

​

In terms of Thomas Kuhn, an IR happens when several technological disruptions confluent. Right now, we are talking of the confluence of developments like the novel metaverse, but also, we must include a fan of technologies close to Corrosionists. Examples include nanotechnology, sensorics, biomimetics, additive manufacturing, virtual reality, and drones. In addition, data analysis, including possibilities like big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, are powerful tools in the hands of Corrosionists that we must apply to solve the old and new challenges concerning the post-globalization era, the post-pandemic time of substantial environmental, societal, economic, and sanitary threats. The paper's purpose has been to present a review of publications about AI and ML applications concerning corrosion problems and the presentation of a proposal of a ML database for predicting electrochemical corrosion. In Principle, AI is a computation way to perceive, reason, and act like human beings. And ML is a branch of it, converting input data as algorithms helpful in making decisions. In the beginning, the application options of AI and ML in predicting electrochemical corrosion problems are enormous, and Corrosionists must use them for more and better solutions according to the requirements of the coming time.

​\
Drawing the conclusions of the study mentioned above and trying to feel what is observed in the environment, we can say that Corrosionists must discuss aspects such as:

​

* Increasing data dimension about corrosion problems is a must.
* Time data is a fundamental input.
* Localized corrosion and inhibitions efficiency need more profound studies.
* Improving data quality is a need. The high-quality training of Corrosionists is directly related.
* More international collaborative work is a basic requirement, and sharing datasets is essential.

​\
In the end, a list of recommendations concerning current options and coming challenges that corrosion scientists and engineers must consider, looking for the best possible solutions in front of the old and new challenges that must be faced. In other words, there are questions to be solved individually and collectively, such as:

​

* How should we Corrosionists face the challenges of post-globalization?
* Currently, technological tools like AI and ML are essential?
* Is it a mistake just to follow the traditional corrosion and protection techniques?
* How to accelerate the transition from conventional corrosion science and engineering to the new integration model between the physical and the digital worlds?
* How to prepare experienced specialists and those in training to face change successfully?

​\
The discussion is open.

​***[To Minimize Risk is Imperative](https://news.materials.business/22-09-2020-to-minimize-risk-is-imperative)***​

The above is a call that must be done permanently for Corrosionists, and all people involved with infrastructure and asset integrity decisions. Behind risk, there are safe, healthy, wealthy threats, and all of them must be bypassed. Unfortunately, today's first news concerns the collapse of a bridge in Pittsburgh, USA, and ten people were injured. Curiously, President Biden was scheduled to talk in the city about his infrastructure plan later. Concerns about the situation of a centenary US infrastructure are growing. Quickly, Bob Chalker, CEO of AMPP, *[issued](http://www.ampp.org/)* a statement about the fatality. Also, additional comments about the great concern about this fact and the general situation of the US infrastructure were published. Colleagues Antonio Serdenes, AMPP Transportation Committee Chair, and Kat Coronado, AMPP Technical Program Committee Chair, spoke about the subject. Bob Chalker remembered the susceptibility of bridges against the corrosive attack and asked rulers for higher efforts to strengthen anticorrosive measurements. Serdenes talked about the cost of the failures and offered the support of AMPP. Meanwhile, Coronado said, “The results of the investigation(s) may influence AMPP’s current education, training, standards, and other technical activities involving coating inspection and corrosion evaluation.”

**Even physical jobs are becoming remote**

Fortunately, positive *[news](https://www.wired.com/story/now-physical-jobs-going-remote/?mc_cid=4788f60c95&mc_eid=88a7fe951a)* also comes to us. Until now, most of the corrosion engineering work has been done vis-à-vis. Before, we have mentioned applications like drones for monitoring infrastructure and online control of cathodic protection systems. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and other technologies allow operating machines from far away. Pandemic fostered remote experiments, and nowadays, doors are open for more robust modeling and simulation options. Scientists are preparing a plenty entrance in the virtual world of research through the metaverse. An interesting example of industrial applications is the remote technology developed by *[Phantom Auto](https://phantom.auto/)*. According to Eric McCarter, Head of QA, virtual reality and other emerging technologies combine to give answers to the remote working needs during Covid-19 pandemics and beyond. In the end, challenges like a deepening labor shortage and more comfortable working conditions could be answered with the new expected innovations..
