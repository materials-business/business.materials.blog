  list of 15 global challenges for humanity, and the first one was Sustainable
  Development and Climate Change. A short while later, the UN launched the first
  version of its Sustainable Development Goals - SDG, including eight targets to
  be reached in 2015, where Goal 7 was “Ensure Environmental Sustainability.”
  Then, the UN launched a new version of the SDG, or the “Global Goals” 2030,
  including 17 interconnected objectives dealing with social, economic, and
  environmental sustainability balance. For instance, SDG 7 is about “Affordable
  and clean energy,” and SDG 11 is “Sustainable cities and communities.” In this
  frame and looking to move “from the words to the actions,” emerged the
  Circular Economy model that many of us are trying to follow right now.

# From The Editor's Corner

# **The air we will breathe​**

**A growing concern**

John Evelyn is the colleague that Corrosionists remember because of his recommendations concerning anticorrosion prevention measurements of the reinforcing metallic bars used in the Saint Paul's cathedral building in London in the 1660s. Evelyn is also recognized as one of the first to call for special attention to sustainability because he warned about overexploitation of natural resources. Three hundred years later, Rachel Carson, a biologist from the United States, reflecting on the risk of the serene scenery she loved in her beloved country place, wrote "Silent Spring." This book became a milestone in the movement towards conservationism. Her ideas were quickly adopted by several movements, like the "Club of Rome" and a UN summit held in Stockholm in 1972 about the Human Environment. Then, a commonly accepted definition was established, saying that sustainable development is "development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Then, in 1992, at the UN summit in Rio de Janeiro, all nations, including the world's leading leaders, recognized sustainable development as the most significant global challenge. At the beginning of the present century, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in the USA asked a group of experts worldwide and finally identified **[14 Grand Challenges](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx)** that engineers need to address in the 21st century, helping humankind flourish and progress. Energy and the environment is one of the fields covered. There is no explicit reference to sustainable development in any of these challenges, but all of them are directly related:

1. Make solar energy economical.

2. Provide energy from fusion.

3. Develop carbon sequestration methods.

4. Manage the nitrogen cycle.

5. Provide access to clean water.

​Besides, the Millennium Project, fostered by the United Nations, established a list of 15 global challenges for humanity, and the first one was Sustainable Development and Climate Change. A short while later**,** the UN launched the first version of its Sustainable Development Goals - SDG, including eight targets to be reached in 2015, where Goal 7 was “Ensure Environmental Sustainability.” Then, the UN **[launched](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals)** a new version of the SDG, or the “Global Goals” 2030, including 17 interconnected objectives dealing with social, economic, and environmental sustainability balance.

​

**A complex world**

At the same time, global economic changes have occurred, driven by innovations mostly related to information technologies. The Information Society and the Knowledge Society established the two branches of the “Global Village,” and globalization becomes the new way of life. Moreover, several technological disruptions have arisen and led to a new industrial revolution. Many new tools for attending sustainability and globalization duties appeared, including nanotechnology, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, etc. But other problems are also possible, and unexpectedly, humanity has been impacted by today's pandemic. But other issues are also possible, and suddenly, society has been affected by today's pandemic. New significant challenges have appeared, mainly concerning social issues like health, peace, justice, equity, and equality. As never before, science saves the situation, and at this moment, humanity makes the future. This will be the future of the atmosphere, the future of the atmospheric corrosion problems and solutions.

​

**Atmospheric corrosion and anti-corrosion in the post-globalization epoch**

The air we will breathe in the coming decades will be the environment corroding materials exposed to the atmosphere. We have **[mentioned](https://news.materials.business/08/06/2021/it-is-pivotal-to-take-care-of-our-neighborhood)** before the effect of the sustainability concerns on the falling of atmospheric pollutants. The consequences include lower corrosion rates and expectations for a lower cost of atmospheric damage to materials and structures. The Corona pandemic must be a catalyzer and a pilot test about more radical changes in such a trend of lower pollution. Many minor changes in habits open the door to further significant transformations. Changes in the job conditions (the “hoffice” or the home + office job), the mobility, the commerce, and so on will be redefining the required infrastructure. Also, We have mentioned the urbanization trends (in an apparent conflict with the pandemic situation) like taller buildings aligned to the idea of the “**[15-minutes city](https://www.15minutecity.com/)**” and other close to sustainability principles like new industrial processes (**[e.gr.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103355)**, amine emissions from carbon capture plants), self-sufficiency trends, and one of the noticeable start ups’ issues today is urban agriculture, including vertical and urban gardens. In brief, new anthropogenic activities, under new conditions, will be brought new atmospheric pollutants, but also old, but neglected air pollutants like carboxylic acids, nitric acid, halures, and VOCs must be considered. Furthermore, natural changes such as global warming and other associated effects such as forest fires and storms alter microclimatic corrosion conditions, usually negatively. Antorphogenic macroclimatic changes could be present, too, affecting in a big way microclimatic atmospheric conditions. We are talking about the plans for developing the so-called “geoengineering,” whose first intention is to diffuse nanoparticles in the upper atmosphere to block solar rays. These trends and plans are just examples of the new demands for materials supporting the expected developments in the coming decades. There is a clear need for cheaper materials with a longer life span, fewer maintenance requirements, and as reusable and recyclable as possible in all situations.

Regarding protection against atmospheric corrosion, we can begin by saying that Corrosionists have identified a long list of variables affecting the phenomena to date. That means that it is complex, and it will become even more. In total agreement with the scientific method, conventional approaches include extreme simplifications. Frequently, problems are understood and resolved. Some others, not. However, today, new tools are opening up the possibility of more complex approaches. In this sense, some of the subjects to be considered studying and solving atmospheric corrosion problems in the coming years include:

​

● Reinforcing learning on corrosion science and engineering.

● Broader actions towards a global awareness of materials and asset handling.

● A truly ***[multidisciplinary](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11869-011-0161-4)*** approach combining corrosion skills with other specialties like atmospheric sciences, climatological experts, construction engineers, architects, environmentalists, etc.

● A deeper dive into the electrochemical cell provoking atmospheric corrosion. That means:

● A better understanding of the dynamics of the interaction ways corrosive-corroded (**[geometry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29132119/)**, **[fluid mechanics](https://doi.org/10.1080/09613218.2018.1468158)**, etc.).

● As **[shown](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ab6c61)** by Professor Sana Virtanen and collaborators at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Germany), a closer approach to the electrode reactions dealt with the study of the cathodic reaction by innovative technique respirometric.

Coming challenges about atmospheric corrosion of materials are enormous, current knowledge must be spread, and a lot of further and different R&D is required.

​**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

**Towards effective ways of carbon sequestration**

Traditional cement is based on calcium silicate, but the new CO₂-infused cement, branded under the name CarbonBuilt, uses hydrated lime, known to absorb CO₂ quickly. Furthermore, the process does not require operation at extreme temperatures or pressure. Another benefit of capturing CO₂ in cement is that unlike other CO₂ -mitigation methods, gas captured from industrial gas can be directly utilized without additional purification or conversion steps. A second demonstration was recently completed at the National Carbon Capture Center in Alabama, producing more than 5,000 concrete blocks using CO₂ emissions from coal and natural gas power plants. Each block can store around 0.75 lb of CO₂. The team expects to significantly scale up production capacities in the coming years.
