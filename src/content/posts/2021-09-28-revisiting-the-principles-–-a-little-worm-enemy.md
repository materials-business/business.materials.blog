  Systematic approaches to the study of the issue occurred with the boom in anti-corrosion paints during the Second Industrial Revolution.

As a result, some of the phenomenological facts around filiform corrosion were understood, and prevention measurements were developed. New efforts by other researchers like Henry Leidheiser at the Lehigh University, in Bethlehem, Pa., USA, were done in the following decades, and knowledge about the phenomenon improved.

  As a primary electrochemical corrosion reaction, filiform corrosion is directly related to heterogeneities. This means degradation associated with heterogeneities or defects on the surface of the substrate, the coating, or the interface in between. In the first place, we can mention inclusions, other chemical differences, or finishing imperfections. However, the most influential factors are related to the interface and the coating. Regarding the interface, we can mention the problems of poor adhesion, but above all, the presence of contaminants on the substrate before the application of the coating (e.g., sodium chloride, calcium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate, flue dust, ash, iron oxide, and carborundum). In the case of the coating, there are also factors that can influence severely the filiform corrosion occurrence like thickness, porosity, permeability through ion channels, scratches, etc. In addition, environmental variables like relative humidity, temperature, and solar radiation have a role. Also, the nature of the interaction, included wet/dry cycles, affects the level of the corrosive attack.

# **Revisiting the principles – a little worm enemy**



Always, to refresh knowledge about the mechanisms of corrosion and protection of materials is valuable, and most of the time, is also funny. In particular, the revisited subject concerns the ultimate basis of the phenomena. This is the case about filiform corrosion, a type of attack that occurs under films or coatings, with a filament appearance, just microns with, but can grow millimeters per day. The problem arises under metallic coatings such as electrodeposits of tin, silver, and gold, and even under conversion coatings like phosphates, but mainly under polymeric coatings and paints on substrates like steel, aluminum, magnesium, and galvanized steel exposed to the atmosphere. Metallic substrates covered by a lacquer are prone to this kind of attack, it is possible to see the appearance of the changes happening under the film, and to understand the occurrence of a corrosion cell, “live”, and very graphically, is possible. On the other side, such a problem usually has a significant aesthetic impact on interest assets.

Many anticorrosive developments have been achieved during all the previous decades. More carefully surface preparation procedures, and much better paint and coating systems have led to a considerable reduction of the problems of filiform corrosion. Corrosionists must keep the phenomenon under control. Then, it is good to remember the more relevant facts about filament formation:

​\
​

● A water concentration gradient can be established in such a weaker point, mainly if the interface shows airborne species affine to water, such as Na+ and Cl-.

● Water diffuses towards the substrate; soluble salt crystallites deliquesce and dissolve into droplets. This solution droplets become retained because of the lesser vapor pressure of the concentrated electrolyte solution than the partial pressure of water vapor in the air.

● Corrosion attack is initiated under electrolyte droplets, leaving circular anodic areas.

● Oxygen acts as the limiting reagent, and a differential aeration cell becomes the driver of the process.

● Other concentration cells are established. In the case of iron contaminated with NaCl, a salt-depleted, extremely acidic, and Cl- enriched zone in front of the filament head has been ***[found](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.1645263)***.

● Ionic species are displaced along the reaction area. A head and a tail are defined, and there is also a reaction control by mass transport.

● With a pH considerably higher than the head, the larger peripheral area acts as a cathode, proportionally demanding high levels of electrons in a somewhat unfavorable relationship of the cathode to the anode.

● The attack spreads step by step, and the circular zones become elliptic due to the directional demand for electronic current.

● The worm or knotty filament grows in a broken line pattern due to a very efficient, demanding cathodic area against a small-rounded tip or head, driven by an aeration cell but controlled by mass diffusion. Meanwhile, a long tail remains behind the front of the attack.

Filiform corrosion can spoil the appearance of a luxury car, but it can also be the start of the catastrophic deterioration of an anti-corrosion coating. There is no little enemy.

According to a statement from the search company Google, he has completed the laying of his giant submarine internet cable Grace Hopper, which pulls a huge area of ​​the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Great Britain before going to Spain. The search giant also announced in August that it had entered into an agreement with Facebook to build a new cable called “Apricot,” which will connect six countries in Southeast Asia using 7,456 miles of cable, the increase in harmful weather events due to climate change can also make submarine cables extremely vulnerable. In 2012, for example, Hurricane Sandy shut down several key exchanges where submarine cables ran between North America and Europe.

**​**

The price of this raw material in the international metal market has been increasing rapidly for a year and a half. Scrap trades at the same level as first-generation aluminum from the bauxite ore from which this material was developed. Scrap can sometimes be paid for a few cents more than primary aluminum, the aluminum sector, which is increasingly demanding this raw material. The worldwide shortage of aluminum has also been proven by the Spanish industry, along with these aluminum producers, Spain has a strong recycling industry that uses this metal as a primary source for products, first, in the segment of aluminum elements for the building. Armando Mateos, President of the Spanish Aluminum Association, explains that there are between 17,000 and 20,000 workers among aluminum producers and extrusion plants and activities directly related to them in Spain.
