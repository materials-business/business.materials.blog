# **OVERHAULING THE MANAGEMENT MODEL**

**​Corrosion management in the New Normal**

Megatrends have been changing the world during the last few years, summarized as integrating the real and the digital worlds. Changes in corrosion protection and asset integrity management have been forced to change too. It is not only an answer to the new challenge, but it also strengthens efforts about old problems, many of them concerning direct management practices. On the other side, sustainability risks growth in a way more disturbing than ever. A significant part of solutions is related to materials engineering and, more specifically, to materials and asset integrity. Suddenly, 2020 arrived with a world tragedy, which has plunged the world into a crisis never imagined. Management duties have changed, and materials integrity staff face unexpected challenges because ‘corrosion was not in quarantine,’ but much of the countermeasures were. We are talking about more problems and difficulties, higher costs, and other unwelcome consequences.

But the crisis is the perfect climate for innovation and further development. There are some identified outcomes supporting the expected picture after the Covid-19, the so-called ‘New Normal.’ A series of new characteristics, bad and good that must be part of the successful planning and management of enterprises over the next years. In principle, scientific knowledge becomes more relevant. Besides, changes at work include, for example, more home office and fewer business travels. Economic effects are enormous, including problems like the increase of inequality and the decimation of small businesses. Furthermore, short and long-term social consequences are arising. The last ones include the possibility of a pandemic world forever. Positive signs emerge, including a new sense of being part of the collective, more human, sharing dreams and visions. Hopefully, a more gregarious and supportive spirit. Better conditions for understanding and exploiting diversity and multidisciplinary. More confidence and better circumstances for collaboration, integration, and networking, even from a distance.

**A known win-win network**

Five decades ago, Jorge Sábato, an Argentinian metallurgist and policymaker, proposed a model of scientific police supported on the relevance of a collaborative triangle government – university (academy) – business. In the 1990s, Netherlander professors L. Leydesdorff and H. Etzkowitz went deeper into the model and, inspired in biomimetic, transformed the triangle into a DNA Triple Helix. Moreover, they imagine a systemic model with the three actors interrelated intimately in a common benefit strategic partnership. It is a relationship in agreement with the theory of the knowledge economy proposed by Robert Solow in 1956 and aimed to better fulfill each of the parties’ missions. A knowledge network where the university can strengthen its role as the knowledge enterprise, the company succeeds in its social responsibility described by Milton Friedman to increase its profits and the government as the catalyzer of the population's socio-economic development whole.​

The USA is an excellent example of the success of the Triple Helix Model. A country where academia puts research capabilities as a breeding ground. Companies and the government put money. The government establishes proper conditions for fruitful interaction, i.e., the Bayh–Dole Act or Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act adopted in 1980 for ruling contract agreements and exploitation of results obtained with federal funding and expected by the companies. This collaboration is one of the main reasons we mention the best university system and the best strongest entrepreneurial conglomeration worldwide. Furthermore, the current development of the SARS-CoV-2 is an example of the power of the Triple Helix collaboration. Responsibilities on the success are shared, but failure, too. The situation in most of the countries is diverse. Often, academia is the “ivory tower” of the former centuries, planning and working far from societal needs, without any stakeholders' incidence. Companies do not trust the academy; they expect the university to be an "employees' factory." Sometimes, they approach the university with the idea that they are just fulfilling their social responsibility. Finally, governments trust neither the academy nor corporations. Moreover, their policies are not aligned to the relevance of scientific and technological knowledge as a factor of richness generation.

Networking is a powerful tool for humankind's development in the coming decades. Nowadays, it is possible to say that the Triple Helix Model is a useful instrument aligning efforts from those three essential social actors: academies, corporations, and governments. A dedicated and most vigorous collaboration will allow using vast amounts of multidisciplinary theoretical knowledge for practical and complex applications for all society's benefit in the post-globalized world, that of the New Normal. The ‘old’ Triple Helix Model becomes more relevant than ever.​

**Triple helix for materials caring**

Management considerations for the next few years must account for facts such as those mentioned above concerning the social and economic changes that are taking place. Asset integrity and corrosion managers need to consider these, and one of the opportunities to do so is to promote and participate in the Triple Helix collaboration actively. However, the most critical point is related to the partnership between academia and business. The sum of efforts between companies, universities, laboratories, research teams, and other knowledge-generating spaces is essential in the face of the complex challenges that arise simultaneously from the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a suitable development, climate change, and post-Corona times. The European Union has recently promoted some experiments on Triple Helix collaborative platforms on specific topics or knowledge domains, such as information technology, water, and clean energy. They are good examples of a pathway that can drive the evolution of corrosion and asset management. Some of the lessons learned include the following:​

\- Voluntary membership.

\- The same level of presence from industry and academia

\- Recognition of different origins and goals

\- Consensual research agendas with shared purposes

\- Cross-sectors collaboration

\- The appearance of the magical synergy ( as in Silicon Valley)

\- To end upbringing R&D closer to the market and society.

A call is made to promote local, national, regional, and finally, global Triple Helix networks in international integration, addressing the corrosion of materials and the assets' integrity. Undoubtedly, most of the functions fall on the leading players, but existing and future associations and other organizations can play a relevant role. Policies that seed such efforts will be welcome but not indispensable. Collaboration is complicated, but with a model like the Triple Helix, it's worth it.

**And exploration restarts**

One more time, humankind exhibits its capacity to find pathways for the challenges emerging from its development. One of the growing difficulties is related to the depletion of mineral sources on the earth. Options under exploration include palliative exploitation of urban scrap or urban mining for secondary raw materials production, exploitation of the seabed, and minerals from the space bodies. An exciting piece of news in this direction concerns the current Chinese Chang’e-5 mission to capture lunar rocks. After more than 40 years of the USA's and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - USSR, initial exploratory journeys, this is the first initiative. The goal is the Rümker’s region, a geological formation of volcanic rocks, around 1.300 million to 1.400 million years old. According to the previous studies, such an area is rich in potassium, rare-Earth elements, and phosphorous, often called KREEP elements. The samples will be shared with research centers worldwide.

**​Measurement of the company’s environmental engagement**

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has launched Circulytics® 2.0. It is a measurement tool supporting company’s qualitative and quantitative movements to the circular economy through an automated scoring process. A group of indicators designed to measure the performance to which a business has achieved circularity purposes across its operations. Outcomes of the measurement practice would be useful for:

\- Identification of opportunities to generate environmental benefits (raw materials, long-life extension, and waste possibilities).

\- Decision-making and strategic development for circular economy adoption.

\- Providing transparency to investors and customers about a company’s circular economy adoption.

\- Benchmarking across more industries.

\- Opening up new opportunities to generate brand value with key stakeholders.
