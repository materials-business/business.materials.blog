# From The Editor's Corner

# **Technology transfer is a valuable tool**

​\
​

**Knowledge exchange as a condition for success**

**​**

Moving towards the Post-globalization era, through the Four Industrial Revolution, the most relevant current factor regarding productivity and wealth generation is knowledge. Nowadays, it is easy to find examples of the income gaps between people, companies, regions, countries, and even subcontinents associated with each situation’s level of knowledge. Besides, education is the starting point for the differences and similarities. Here we had emphasized the importance of much better education of the Corrosionist that must be attending to the materials deterioration challenges in the coming decades. Long-term education is a requirement for successful professionals these days. That means school and continuous education also. Much of this long-life learning is extracurricular and includes formal and non-formal programs, planned activities or not. In situ or abroad. Training in the workplace is almost universal, but it is less than enough. Permanent training in new skills and knowledge update about the field of specialization and beyond is a must. Pathways are many, some of them unscrupulous ways, such as industrial espionage, further than the simple and “naive” industrial visits. However, there are several other legitimate options that managers and Corrosionists themselves can apply.

​

Scientific and technical literature in books, magazines, and scientific journals is an option for self-learning. Access to them is essential. Lack of access explains the discrepancy between countries and entities where international data flows are available at the right time**.** Instead, others have limited access because of the cost (sometimes it is because of the language). In this sense, one of the positive facts aligned with the purpose of a better society for all is the recent trend of accessible free of charge scientific journals. Another branch of the technical literature is related to patents. In this case, we are talking about a bank of almost one hundred million documents published during the last two centuries. Most of them obsolete, but the others will be useful today. And according to legal regulations regarding their use, a significant proportion is free now, and you can use them free of charge. Others, still under in force protection, can be transacted as any merchandise, and you can pay for the information contained. Another kind of information than patents is also commercial, as the industrial secret is—entities and channels as Materials.Business promote disseminating technical knowledge, and their role will become increasingly relevant as we move into post-globalization.

​

The commercialization of patents and other ways of knowledge transfer as franchises and technical assistance are entirely valid and, in some way, a solution to inappropriate copying, piracy, and information stolen. But a successful business about knowledge transfer needs an excellent knowledge of the market, the offered options, and the right negotiation skills. It is necessary to be updated permanently, and to do that, probably the best way is networking. Participate in a network of national and international colleagues seeking collaboration, even among competitors. Networks helpful in diving deeper into their expertise, but also as a way of opening the vision of the transversal subjects that complement and enrich each specialty. Networks into the business and clusters, chains, and multisectoral as the Triple Helix Industry-Academia--Government relationship.

​

However, networking requires meeting points for the exchange of information. Before the pandemic, most of these meeting points included the charm of the face-to-face. Visits, stays, internships, meetings, and so on were part of the common practice between successful entrepreneurs. International business traveling was distinctive of the globalization times, before SARCoV-2. Nowadays, virtualization has been accelerated, and most of the above activities have become in the distance, virtual, online. Social media-supported apps like LinkedIn and Facebook and digital tools like Zoom and Skype have become the common meeting points for networking and knowledge exchange.

​\
​

**Associations as ideal meeting points**

​

Scientific and technical networking is not new. History mentions their meeting points in Classic Greece, 2.500 years ago. It is well known that English societies were at the origin of the First and Second Industrial Revolutions, and some of the institutions currently relevant, as the Royal Society, are the inheritor of those old initiatives. In addition, some of the more renowned journals today, like Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America. Following this pathway, many of the more important professional societies today, born at the effervescence of the Second Industrial Revolution, such as the ASME (1880), IEEE (1884), ASM (1913), etc. Then, “**[NACE](https://www.nace.org/about/nace-history)** International was established in 1943 by eleven corrosion engineers from the pipeline industry as the "National Association of Corrosion Engineers." The founding engineers were originally part of a regional group formed in the 1930s when the study of cathodic protection was introduced”. Besides, in 1950 was established the SSPC. And most of us know, these two last associations merged last year, becoming the stronger the Association for Materials Protection and Performance – AMPP. Even though almost all the associations were national initially, many of the held events had foreign participation. Thus, some international associations were also appearing. One of them, in 1963, was the International Corrosion Council – **[ICC](https://icc-net.org/)**. In principle, the ICC is an association of national associations and other institutions (universities, companies, and government entities) committed to the science and engineering of corrosion and protection. Nowadays, the ICC has representatives from more than 65 countries worldwide.

​\
​\
​**An extraordinary summit in the virtual space**

​\
One of the objectives of the ICC is to convene a periodical world meeting. The first one was in 1961, as a preamble of the ICC, and the coming one, the 21st International Corrosion Congress, will be held virtually next week, from Tuesday to Friday, July 20th to 23rd of 2021. On this occasion, the organization is under the responsibility of the Brazilian Association of Corrosion – ABRACO. The motto of the 21st ICC is “Smart Solutions for Asset Integrity.” Around the organization, many companies are supporting and participating, such as Aperam, Sandvik, Jotum, Gamry, Gerdau, Hita-Belzona, Institute of Corrosion, and Metrohm. Also, many Brazilian governmental entities (IPT, CNPq, FAPESP, CAPES, etc.), Universities (the University of Sao Paulo and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), institutes (IPEN, INT, IPT, etc. And professional associations (ABNT, ABINX, ABENDI, ABAL; ABCP, ABCEM, etc.). Of course, also hundreds of Corrosionists from around the world, presenting their advances and doing networking. Some of the most globally recognized Corrosionists will be plenary lectures: Oscar Rosa Mattos (Brazil, editor of Corrosion Science), Gerald Frankel (the USA, editor of the Journal of the Electrochemical Society), Nick Birbilis (Australia, editor of npj Materials Degradation), V.S.Raja (India, Transactions of the Indian Institute of Metals), Randa Abdel-Karim (Vice Dean for Community Services and Environmental Affairs- Faculty of Engineering, Egypt), Günter Schmitt (Germany, current President of the ICC), Mario Ferreira (Portugal, Marcel Pourbaix Award 2021), and Tesuo Shoji (Japan, Marcel Porbaix Award, 2021). These and many other reasons included in the entire program of the meeting are the powerful reasons for inviting all of us to attend the 21st International Corrosion Congress, including its commercial exhibition, which can be visited free of charge. As the President of ABRACO and the Organizing Committee, Prof. Zehbour Panossian, “the main global corrosion congress.”

# Materials Biz News

**Infrastructure needs Corrosionists caring**

After watching the news of the sudden, catastrophic collapse of a 40-year-old apartment building near Miami, my wife wondered about all sorts of things. How do you prevent the failure or damage of rust at your home? Use the best metal parts for an outdoor deck with a thick zinc coating. It is simple; initial reports indicated that the cause of the collapse could have been weakened concrete and unstable soil under the structure. It will take months to complete a forensic study of this disaster, so keep in mind that much of what you see in the news is speculation.

**Fighting against aircraft corrosion**

Now, a team at the US Navy's Fleet Readiness Center East - FRCE examines new possibilities to detect corrosion and prevent its spread quickly and accurately. The F-35 Lightning II program at FRCE recently demonstrated a tool that can help identify corrosion across multiple aircraft coatings: The Gray Gecko Real-Time Inspection Tool, or system. GRIT is designed for use on the aircraft side by traditional maintenance personnel. To complement the phases of non-destructive testing, the total depot provides service to the fleet while operating as an integral part of the larger United States.
