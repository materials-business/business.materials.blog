  Thus, it is very important to stop treating CO₂ as waste. Instead, we need to
  look at it as a building block of chemicals and fuels. While researchers work
  towards developing efficient and industrially competitive alternative
  technologies to fossil fuels, capture and conversion of CO₂ are essential to
  decrease emissions. Some industries already use CO₂ as raw material, for
  example, for the production of urea (for fertilizers) and plastics. Many more
  useful products could be made from CO₂, such as olefins, methanol, and fuels.
  However, as illustrated in this review article, there are still some
  limitations to the use of CO₂ in industry, mainly related to the capture and
  transport of CO2.


  But first, let’s have a look at the key steps to produce useful chemicals from CO₂. The first step is CO₂ capture, either directly from the atmosphere or from the flue gases of industrial processes. Capturing CO₂ from the air is mainly limited by the low concentration in the atmosphere (400 ppm). Thus, CO₂ capture from industrial flue gases becomes more attractive. In this case, it is necessary to separate the carbon dioxide from the rest of the flue gas components. This is mostly done by adsorption in liquid solvents (monoethanolamine, MEA), but solid adsorbents can be also used (activated carbons, molecular sieves, zeolites, and polymers). After capture, compression and transport of CO₂ are the bottlenecks for its commercialization. Trucks are commonly used to deliver CO₂ by road. Pipelines are also being implemented, but this is only cheaper if it is done on a large scale.


  After CO₂ capture, separation, and transport, we need to convert this gas into valuable products in an efficient way. This is not easy, as carbon dioxide is a very stable molecule. It requires a lot of energy to break this molecule to make new chemicals, and this usually means high temperatures (> 1000 °C). To reduce the energy penalty of CO₂ conversion, this gas is usually mixed with other reactants, such as butane or H₂. In addition, catalysis becomes essential to accelerate the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that lowers the activation barrier of the reaction and speeds it up, while it is not itself consumed. The importance of catalysis and its impact on our society has been recognized throughout the years with several Nobel Prizes, including this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis.

# **What to do with CO₂? From waste to useful chemicals**​ ​

​

The increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a global concern due to its link to ***[climate change](https://climate.nasa.gov/)***. The rise in global temperatures, the shrinking of the arctic ice, the mass loss of ice sheets, and the increase in the global average sea level are related to the emissions of this greenhouse gas. We can also already see more frequent *[**extreme weathe**r](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58073295)* events, such as record heat waves, deadly floods, and wildfires.

Only in 2019, ***[36 million tonnes of CO](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)*₂** were emitted into the atmosphere. The main sources of this gas are carbon-based power plants, transport, and heavy industry such as steel, cement, and hydrogen production.

The most direct way to reduce CO₂ emissions is to stop producing them, but finding cleaner and profitable alternatives to fossil fuels remains a big challenge. Considering the large volumes of fossil fuels that are consumed and available today, these could still use them for at least another 100 years. In addition, several economies are still strongly dependent on ***[coal](https://www.worldstopexports.com/coal-exports-country/)***, such as Australia or Colombia.

Thus, it is very important to stop treating CO₂ as waste. Instead, we need to look at it as a building block of chemicals and fuels. While researchers work towards developing efficient and industrially competitive alternative technologies to fossil fuels, capture and conversion of CO₂ are essential to decrease emissions. Some industries already use CO₂ as raw material, for example, for the production of urea (for fertilizers) and plastics. Many more useful products could be made from CO₂, such as olefins, methanol, and fuels. However, as illustrated in ***[this review article](https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201900915)***, there are still some limitations to the use of CO₂ in industry, mainly related to the capture and transport of CO2.

But first, let’s have a look at the key steps to produce useful chemicals from CO₂. The first step is **CO₂ capture**, either directly from the atmosphere or from the flue gases of industrial processes. Capturing CO₂ from the air is mainly limited by the low concentration in the atmosphere (400 ppm). Thus, CO₂ capture from industrial flue gases becomes more attractive. In this case, it is necessary to separate the carbon dioxide from the rest of the flue gas components. This is mostly done by adsorption in liquid solvents (monoethanolamine, MEA), but solid adsorbents can be also used (activated carbons, molecular sieves, zeolites, and polymers). After capture, **compression and transport of CO₂** are the bottlenecks for its commercialization. Trucks are commonly used to deliver CO₂ by road. Pipelines are also being implemented, but this is only cheaper if it is done on a large scale.

After CO₂ capture, separation, and transport, we need to convert this gas into valuable products in an efficient way. This is not easy, as carbon dioxide is a very stable molecule. It requires a lot of energy to break this molecule to make new chemicals, and this usually means high temperatures (> 1000 °C). To reduce the energy penalty of **CO₂ conversion**, this gas is usually mixed with other reactants, such as butane or H₂. In addition, **catalysis** becomes essential to accelerate the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that lowers the activation barrier of the reaction and speeds it up, while it is not itself consumed. The importance of catalysis and its impact on our society has been recognized throughout the years with several ***[Nobel Prizes](https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i36/Nobel-Prizes-Recognized-Notable-Developments.html)***, including this year’s ***[Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2021/press-release/)*** for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis.

There are different types of catalysis for CO₂ conversion – electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, plasma-catalysis, and thermal catalysis are some examples. In my doctoral thesis - ***[What to do with CO](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=73c08f96-923a-4fd1-ba38-36aea6c09854)₂[? Towards valuable chemicals using plasma and catalysis](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=73c08f96-923a-4fd1-ba38-36aea6c09854)*** – we can find some examples where CO₂ is converted to useful chemicals using thermal heterogeneous catalysis. I performed this work at the ***[University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-science/contact-and-location/amsterdam-science-park/amsterdam-science-park.html)*** (2016-2020), under the supervision of*[ **Dr. N. Raveendran Shiju**](https://hims.uva.nl/content/research-groups/catalysis-engineering/catalysis-engineering.html)* and ***[Prof. Gadi Rothenberg](https://hims.uva.nl/content/research-groups/heterogeneous-catalysis-and-sustainable-chemistry/people/people.html)***.

For the conversion of CO₂ using heterogeneous catalysis we place a solid catalyst in the gaseous reaction media. There are different requirements for a ‘good catalyst’, such as high conversion levels and high selectivity towards the desired product, thus avoiding additional separation steps. High long-term stability is also important, as in industry catalysts preferably run for a long time (days, months…) without decreasing its productivity or the need to be replaced.

Common catalysts are supported materials, where the active component is dispersed over a supporting matrix. The active component is a metal or metal oxide (for example, cobalt or cobalt oxide), while the support (commonly alumina, silica, and titania, among others) is typically stable and inert. Nevertheless, certain supports play a crucial role in catalysis as they are in close contact with the active site.

Through national and international collaborations, during my PhD I focused on exploring the performance of a family of novel materials called **MAX phases** as supports of metal oxides. MAX phases, such as Ti₃AlC or Ti₂AlN, are a family of layered ternary carbides and nitrides that combine ceramic and metallic properties: they show high-temperature strength and stiffness, and at the same time they are tough, ductile, and conduct electricity and heat. Therefore, they have been typically used for mechanical and thermal applications, such as structural coatings in fission and fusion reactors. Nevertheless, the ***[catalytic properties of MAX phases](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201702196)*** have attracted more attention in the last years.

We found that cobalt oxide supported on **[Ti](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cssc.202001633)₂[AlC MAX phase](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cssc.202001633)** catalyst was active, selective, and stable during the butane dry reforming reaction. This reaction converts CO₂ and butane to synthesis gas. Synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) is used in industry as the precursor of valuable chemicals, such as fuels or alcohols through the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Another type of MAX phase, Ti₃AlC₂, also showed interesting results when used as a support for molybdenum oxide during the reverse water-gas shift reaction. *[**In this study**,](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c07881)* the MAX phase catalyst increased the conversion of CO₂ and hydrogen compared to traditional materials at 550 °C. The main product of this reaction is carbon monoxide, a basic building block for a variety of important chemicals, such as paraffins and olefins.

It is interesting to mention that the chemical treatment of MAX phases results in the formation of **MXenes**, a new family of 2D layered materials. MXenes are interesting in catalysis as their interlayer space and surface area are enhanced compared to MAX phases. In addition, they are hydrophilic, chemically stable, and excellent electrical conductors. Due to the high electrical conductivity and the high ion diffusion rate between layers, MXenes have been mainly used for energy storage devices and electrocatalysis. They are also promising materials for heterogeneous catalysis, and they have already been used in the ***[direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene](https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.8b02002)*** and *[**ammonia borane hydrolysis**,](https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/ababef)* among other reactions.

Another strategy to activate stable molecules like CO₂ is the use of **plasma**. Plasma is a partially ionized gas that contains electrons, excited molecules and atoms, radicals, ions, and neutral gas species. This ionized gas is usually created by applying an electric discharge between two electrodes, which are located inside a reactor filled with gas. The electrons in the plasma can activate inert molecules, while the bulk gas phase of the plasma remains near room temperature. For example, we studied how plasma-catalysis can be used to convert ***[CO](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c05565)₂[ to methanol](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c05565)*** at near-ambient temperature and pressure (30 °C and 1 bar).

More information on the workings of plasma-catalysis and details on our research can be found in my doctoral thesis, available ***[here](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=73c08f96-923a-4fd1-ba38-36aea6c09854)***. There you will also find a summary in English, Spanish, Dutch, and German.

**​[The metaverse: a fantastic world of possibilities for corrosionists](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/nvidia-ceo-says-the-metaverse-could-save-companies-billions.html)​**

**​**

​***[Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)*** CEO Jensen Huang appeared in “***[Mad Money](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/nvidia-ceo-says-the-metaverse-could-save-companies-billions.html)***” two days after Nvidia reported higher-than-expected revenues and earnings for the third quarter. Also, Nvidia’s employment has skyrocketed in recent weeks, fueled by optimism among investors in the metaverse. Although this concept, called omniverse by Nvidia, is familiar for people involved with science-fiction, it is new for the rest. But now, with companies like Facebook betting for the subject like a business of the coming years, metaverse becomes a new emerging technology strengthening the impact of the Four Industrial Revolution. Expectations from Nvidia are associated with Huang’s vision about a virtual reality universe as a space for simulated economic operations, including factories, plants, processes, power grids, etc., cutting wastes and increasing efficiency. In the end, companies could obtain vast amounts of money in savings. Recent recognition by the ***[Times magazine](https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2021/)*** named Nvidia Omniverse as one of the best 100 innovations of 2021. Indeed, a new slot of opportunities for Corrosionists today and during the coming years.
