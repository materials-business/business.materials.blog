# **THE VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

**The intangible is also worth a lot**

Last month, after a five-year court battle, the USA Federal Circuit Judge ruled that the US Navy must pay nearly USD $600 million in compensation to the German company **[Bitmanagement Software GmbH](https://www.bitmanagement.com/)**. But why? Well, the initial business transaction between the two included Bitmanagement selling 38 licenses worth USD $5.490 for a tracking software program that monitored simultaneous VR users doing Navy installations and services. This software program was protected by the US copyrighting office. However, 430.000 extra copies of the software were distributed throughout the Navy, “without authorization, without a license, and without payment." Although the product itself was just “knowledge” or somewhat know-how, it was still an asset; an intangible one. This was not the first time that this happened, but nevertheless, it is not a court’s usual judgment in such a sense. Copyright is an issue of intellectual property, and protecting this kind of asset of growing importance.

**​“Knowledge is Power”**

As quoted (or sometimes paraphrased) by the many great minds in humanity’s history, including Francis Bacon, Thomas Jefferson, and others; Knowledge is power. We are talking about the step by step increasing relevance of knowledge with time. Sage, wise, erudite, savant, guru, smart, and sapient are just examples of words we give to those with any influence because of their higher knowledge. Some centuries ago, knowledge started to be formally protected by tools like patents. In a way, it was a kind of recognition for its economic value, and so the quote could be adjusted to “knowledge is money.” The fundament of patenting is based on a social contract that guarantees the exclusivity of the financial exploitation of the protected knowledge to the patent owner for a certain amount of time. For example, last February, the US patent safeguarding **[Stratasys](https://www.stratasys.com/)**’ right over its famous heated build chamber for 3D printing expired. Sometimes, patent owners are the inventors themselves and are very well known, e.g., Thomas Alva Edison and Alfred Nobel. According to Economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx, during the First Industrial Revolution, land, labor, and capital were the primary inputs or factors for profits generated by a business.

​However, the amount of knowledge found in the world was forever increasing. So in the 1950s, Robert Solow found that it was necessary to add a new factor to explain the excess of founded total production using the original equation. This unique factor is now known as the so-called “the Solow residual” or total factor productivity – TFP; a factor aimed at capturing the role of knowledge in economic growth. This was the foundation for the “Knowledge Society.” A few decades later emerged the “globalization” model of development, which was supported on the leg of ITC on one side and the Knowledge Society on the other. Subsequently, innovation became perhaps the more critical factor in the TFP equation, besides capital and land (raw materials, buildings, hardware, fabrics, vehicles, etc.), or just workforce.

​Moreover, about ten years ago, the world stepped into the Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the characteristics of this Industrial Revolution is that the influence of knowledge as a productivity factor is growing exponentially (not a residual!). Undoubtedly, this will be the new era’s main feature after the pandemic; the “post-globalization.” **[Visible forces from land, labor, and capital, are being substituted by invisible or dark ones](https://youtu.be/wGbLj3-Apyg)** (remember the dark forces of the universe proposed by Einstein?), with knowledge at the top, just look at the example of the astronomic increase of the value of pharmaceutical companies just because of prospects (intangible) regarding the CoVID-19 vaccine.

​​**Corrosion, anticorrosion, and industrial asset management in the post-globalization era**

Most of our efforts point to taking care of materials, parts, and equipment in economic sectors like manufacturing, O&G, utilities, chemical & pharma, mining, transportations & warehousing, construction, & building. Most of these are capital-intensive sectors with substantial physical assets to protect against deterioration. However, the essence of the current industrial revolution is the integration between the physical and virtual worlds. Currently, most of us do not use a GPS gadget in our car anymore; instead, we either use a vehicle with an integrated GPS software tool or our phone. This was a change that happened in less than ten years since the gadget's first appearance on the market (see how change is accelerated?). Consequently, some of the physical assets are moving to be digital ones, and so we can say that the sectors mentioned above are shifting to more knowledge-intensive ones. These sectors move slower than sectors like ICT or media, but nevertheless, moving. In the future, corrosionist will not need to care for the physical inventory. Technologies such as additive manufacturing are driving the transformation of physical to digital parts in stock. Companies should now worry about incorporating knowledge into the digital libraries and all their software programs—intangible, non-corrodible assets. Although, printers must be cared by corrosionist.

​Moreover, a corrosionist is an expert, a person with valuable knowledge, an intangible asset. Tangible assets must be protected, and so must the intangible ones too. Intangible assets include non-physical but identifiable assets, such as goodwill (brand recognition, customer loyalty, and others that cannot exist independently), which cannot be sold, purchased, or transferred separately. Other intangible assets such as website domain names, intellectual property (industrial secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing agreements, etc.), franchises, computer software, films, etc., can be bought and sold independently of the business itself.

​The symbiosis between the physical and digital worlds brings significant changes not only in our personal lives but in companies’ lives too. Below is a comparison of the Top 10 most valuable enterprises in the world from way back then and now:

![](/assets/captura-de-pantalla-2021-03-08-a-la-s-2.36.56-p. m..png)

According to these two lists, financial and other tangible assets completely lost their value compared to intangible assets. In 1989, intangibles were not of value to companies. Nowadays, intangibles are “the value.”

Another way of approaching the changes that are happening now concerns the average time it takes for a company to reach a USD $1.000 million valuation, which used to be 20 years on average. In contrast, now, it only takes four years for digital start-ups to reach this value. Nowadays, things that are easier to be accountable for are less valuable (e.g., physical assets) than items that are difficult to account for (e.g., intangible assets) in the companies’ financial statements. Now, we must ask ourselves, how big has the effect been of the slow-movement towards digitalization in the capital-intensive sectors? Well, big. Now it’s the time for corrosionists to become in charge of intangible asset management. To answer how to do this requires us to look at some considerations about duties and priorities.

​**What we need to do**

The starting point is the knowledge of corrosion science and engineering. Looking at this, there are some topics to keep in mind by corrosionists in the post-globalization era:

​- Staff education and training**.** It’s good to remember that industrial concerns and efforts about corrosion grew in the 1950s and 1960s. Reasons included estimating the cost of the problem and the subsequent birth and strengthening professional associations and universities’ interest in the subject. As a result, companies had well-trained personnel during the following decades. But companies were not prepared for managing knowledge, and so consequently, knowledge on corrosion handling was not well documented, as most of it was just kept in the staffs’ minds. And so, most of the knowledge, especially company-specific information, was gone when employees left the company. People worked for three or four decades before they retired, and there were and still are not any proper generational switching plans. Furthermore, universities began cutting specific corrosion topics in their curricula many years ago. And so, to avoid any loss of knowledge, some tasks that need to be done include further interaction between companies and universities, better documentation processes, and effective management of the personnel moving.

​- Knowledge is the principal company asset today and must be appropriately managed. Corrosionists must use their expertise according to the possibilities while protecting and enriching it in the best possible way. Likewise, for protecting goodwill, the corrosionist must produce intangible assets like designs, methodologies, procedures, algorithms, software, books, films, industrial solutions, and inventions, and protect them through industrial secret, copyright, patent, licensing agreement, franchising, etc. This means that basic training in intellectual property management is essential.

\- Information is becoming the “raw material” by excellence. Data, ideas, communications, emotions “are becoming more valuable than oil” because they are the current inputs of the TFP equation (today, we pay international calls and other services with our information). Therefore, “catching” them is vital for a corrosionist looking for the new era's intangible and mixed enterprises, the “dark economy.” Issues concerning information include generation, transmission, analysis, validation, and processing. **[Technological surveillance](https://www.pregon.com.ar/nota/6585/21/02/vigilancia-tecnologica-e-inteligencia-estrategica)** is an instrument for spotting relevant information, and we need to do that. It is necessary to follow new trends, research projects under development, new inventions, innovations within businesses, and potential partners and rivals. Looking for a competitive advantage must be looked at as “strategic intelligence” and used as an analytic tool for exploiting the vast amount of information available today and for decision-making support. Thinking about the above issues, six months ago, we launched **[Materials Business](https://news.materials.business/)** as a platform full of valuable information for your decisions about physical and digital industrial assets performance and protection.

​**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

​**Drones helping us with infrastructure inspection**

The North Caroline Department of Transportation in the USA has started to inspect its infrastructure with drones. Two weeks ago, the NCDOT personnel conducted the biennial inspection of the 4.5 km **[Marc Basnight Bridge](https://www.hdrinc.com/portfolio/marc-basnight-bridge-bonner-bridge-replacement)** over the Oregon Inlet, using a “Skydio 2” drone as a complementary tool for the visual, traditional inspection. The crew monitored live high-definition video feeds from the drone as it was flown around the bridge’s ten largest columns, looking for any potential defects that would require further action. Savings in time, money, and lane closures were evident.
