  We are water


  Nowadays, outstanding news is concerned with signs of water in the Moon, Mars, or other objects in the interstellar system. The answer is paramount for several reasons. First of all, life is water. As a consequence, we living beings are “water” and the Earth is the “blue planet”. On average, more than 60 percent of the human body is water. That means that the heart and brain are more than 70 percent water, kidneys, and muscles are almost 80 percent, and the lung is about 83 percent. Survival is conditional on minimum water consumption (about 2-3 liter per day for an adult person). One of the biggest challenges today is to find answers to climate change, and an option could be to get “one planet” more.

**We are water**

Nowadays, outstanding news is concerned with signs of water in the Moon, Mars, or other objects in the interstellar system. The answer is paramount for several reasons. First of all, life is water. As a consequence, we living beings are “water” and the Earth is the “blue planet”. On average, more than 60 percent of the human body is water. That means that the heart and brain are more than 70 percent water, kidneys, and muscles are almost 80 percent, and the lung is about 83 percent. Survival is conditional on minimum water consumption (about 2-3 liter per day for an adult person). One of the biggest challenges today is to find answers to climate change, and an option could be to get “one planet” more.

​

Another essential aspect of life is hygiene, or the degree of cleanliness of a person and their environment, seeking the prevention of any disease. Here, we appeal to one of the properties of water-related to its solvent capacity, the "universal solvent" as it is called. Good hygiene is the explanation of a healthier, stronger, taller, and long-life people today, in comparison to predecessor generations. Also, empirical explanations justify the lower affection of Jewish people by the black plague during the Middle Ages, associated with the ritual of hand-washing practice. There's no doubt that sanitation measurements are healthy, mainly now with the occasion of the COVID pandemic, when one of the more significant instructions has to do with frequent hand-washing. In other words, water is essential for a healthy life, too.

​

​

**A terrifying drought**

One of the biggest problems concerning climate change is related to the accelerated growth of water scarcity. It is very well known that this requirement has been a ceaseless difficulty for people and animals, along with history. Droughts have been the culprit of the main vectors (both in direction, and amount) of migration of living beings along with their existence. Currently, 838 million people worldwide do not have enough freshwater to face their basic needs (drinking, cooking, and sanitation), and about one-third of the global population lack access to a basic sanitation system. From the total global water (about 332.5 million cubic miles), only 2.5 percent is freshwater. 68.7 percent of the freshwater is as glaciers and ice caps. 30.1 is groundwater, and just 1.2 percent is surface freshwater and other depots (lakes, soil moisture, atmosphere, swamps/marshes, rivers, and living beings). But droughts are differential by regions, countries, and localities. Australasia and Latin America & the Caribbean, are fortunately because actual renewable freshwater resources per capita are estimated as above 35.000 m3 per year. On the other hand, regions like the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Pacific Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa are below 10.000 m3. Furthermore, by 2025, water withdrawals will be increased by 50 percent in developing countries, and 18 percent in developed ones. The most worrying situation is in the MENA region because per capita availability in 1950 was 4.000 m3, currently is 1.100 3, and predictions indicate that they will drop by half, reaching 550 m3 per person per year in 2050.

​

By region, the distribution between countries is not equitable, neither. In Latin America, Colombia has 45.668 m3 per person per year, and Argentina 6.843 m3. In Central Europe, Germany has 1.321 m3, and Austria has 6.435 m3. Meanwhile, Bahrain is 3 m3, and Peru is 54.536 m3. But the Peruvian Pacific sub-region, with 66 percent of the total population, only has 2.2 percent of the total available freshwater in the country. Such inequities at several levels are the explanation of the sometimes called “water wars”.

​

​

**A perennial concern for engineers**

Also, the above-described situation is more than enough reason because Goal 6 of the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable development states the challenge of “ensuring the availability of water and its sustainable management, and sanitation for all”. The specific targets of this UN goal include issues like improving water quality by reducing pollution, minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials, substantially increase water-use efficiency, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, expand capacity-building support in activities as water desalination, and water efficiency. It is not necessary to make big efforts to understand that all these challenges are directly related to materials engineering and specifically to corrosion science and engineering. Most of the access limitations to drinking water are due to lack of infrastructure or poor management.

​

Solutions to the above requirements had been given by several civilizations. In many cases, human settlements were established close to water sources, especially rivers. Sometimes, fabulous engineering works were built, including meaningful lessons for a sustainable future. Ancient Chinese cities had their urban water system of interconnected elements, including a water supply river, urban channels, an internal draining system, ponds and lakes, fosses, and drainage, with intensive use of bricks and earthen pipelines. Some of them, like the aqueduct in Hangzhou, still in operation after 3000-4000 years of use. Very famous in Europe are the remains and ruins of the Roman aqueducts, monumental engineering works, usually with tens of kilometers of length, including arches, bridges, tunnels, channels, reservoirs, and other original components and hydraulic inventions to guarantee high-quality freshwater to the big cities of that time, in Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, North Africa, and so on. In Rome, the first aqueduct was built in 312 BC. Then, in the 2nd Century C.E., eleven aqueducts supplied about 10 m3/s of water to the City. At that time, the estimated population was between 500,000 and 1,000000 inhabitants. That meant a supply of 800-1.600 L/d/person, a huge amount in comparison to the current supply. One of the highest consumptions in the world, in 2019, was in New York with 447 L/d/p.

​

​

**Corrosion is always on the lookout**

The basic material used by Romans on their aqueduct primary networks, were stone, ceramic brinks, and “Roman Concrete” (pozzolana ash and lime mixed with water or seawater for marine environments). An associated development was related to the distribution network system across the city. Lead pipes were in use 2.000 years ago, but problems arose. At that time, in his book “*De Architectura*”, Vitruvius wrote that when water moves through leaded pipes, “the lead receives the current of air, the fumes from it occupy the members of the body, and burning them thereupon, rob the limbs of the virtues of the blood. Therefore, it seems that water should not be brought in lead pipes if we desire it to be wholesome.” This concern supports the suggestions of researchers such as Jerome Nriagu, of the University of Michigan, about lead poisoning associated with health problems of the Roman elite, with diseases such as lead poisoning (a neurotoxin), and that may have accelerated the fall of the empire. Then, according to recent studies, it was found that “tap water” from ancient Rome had 100 times more Pb than local spring waters. Although it may be exaggerated that Pb poisoning led to the collapse of an empire. The risk of lead poisoning has been documented in different moments, and today it can be affirmed that it is a relevant public health problem. Not only because of Pb pipes, but accessories and soldering filler material are responsible, too. Last year, Belgian newspapers reported risky levels of Pb in the tap water of some police stations. However, the biggest problem concerning corrosion of the drinking water network happened recently in a developed country was the “Flint water crisis”, a city with more than 100.000 residents, in Michigan (USA).

​

​

**Corrosion sickens and kills**

In April 2014, Flint’s water supply was switched from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, sourced from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the Flint River. Immediately, there were public complaints about water quality. It changed its appearance and odor, people became poisoned by lead, supply networks started to corrode catastrophically, leaks appeared everywhere, and sediment clogged equipment. In the beginning, twelve people died because of Legionnaire’s disease, and the total killed people along the coming months was calculated to about 100. The water supply system was switched back to the former one, on October 16th, 2015. But, in February 2016, more than 600 of 9.300 water tests showed Pb levels above 15 ppb, the federal action limitation. Eleven of the samples revealed above 150 ppb of Pb. Besides, coliform bacteria, and high levels of trihalomethanes (THMs), have been associated with the problem. Not good decisions behind the supplying change are also related to the failure to apply corrosion inhibitors to the water (with a cost of about $150 US dollars a day). Also, bad management that veiled the investigations.

​

​

**Corrosion costs**

Consequences of “Flint’s crisis” included managers’ resignations and dismissals. Fifteen criminal charges, with one of them convicted. Nowadays, victims have been compensated with $600 million US dollars. Furthermore, the affected drinking water system included 930 km of distribution pipe, 7.000 valves, and 28.000 service lines. Root solutions began to be applied, supported on new techniques as machine learning, and to date, more than 26.000 excavations of water service lines had been done, including the change of *circa* 10.000 Pb pipes, resting about ten percent of the network to be inspected. What could be the total cost of that poor corrosion management decision?

​

Here, we are in front of another face of aqueducts corrosion, its cost. The “Flint crisis” affected less than 1.000 km of piping. But in the US, and according to the American Water Works Association, the total length of the drinking water piping systems is about 1.900.000 km (two thousand more than the above amount). Also, each year about 240.000 water main breaks happen, much of wish are caused by corrosion. Repairing and replacing old water pipes, over the next two decades, could cost more than $1.000.000 million US dollars. These figures encompass figures of a study about the cost of corrosion on the US drinking water and sewage sector in 2001, showing that the total cost of corrosion was $36.000 million US dollars. In the case of Australia, the second most common reason for leaking in the water sector is corrosion. Many not direct and intangible costs include watering restrictions, flooding, affected infrastructure, remediation, repair, delays on human activities, and others. As a result, the yearly cost of corrosion of the water industry in Australia has been estimated at $91 million Australian dollars. A Colombian study, led by the Editor, showed that the cost of corrosion in the utility sector in 1994 (drinking water, sewage, gas, and electricity), was equivalent to 9.03 percent of the GDP, most of such amount associated with aqueducts. In a more recent study (<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41529-017-0005-2>), the total, direct, and indirect cost of the water supply and drainage systems in China in 2014, was calculated as 3.360 million US dollar.

​

Good quality drinking water is worth it. Proper management of corrosion in aqueduct networks ensures such quality and saves lives and money. **Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is good business!**
