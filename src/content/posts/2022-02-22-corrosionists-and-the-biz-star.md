**Corrosionists and the biz star**

​

Here Without any doubt, the Oil & Gas industry has been the crown jewel of the world business and economy because it has powered the world since almost two hundred years ago. At the time, O&G has been the key sector in the field of corrosion and protection of materials and assets, owing to the fact of its economic relevance but also because it is one of the industries more prone to the deterioration of their assets due to the aggressiveness of the raw materials, the exploitation environments, and the chemical, thermal, and mechanical requirements of the refining process. It is easy to understand why many Corrosionists are involved with the O&G sector. But also, why it has been recently *[estimated](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41529-017-0005-2)* that the total direct corrosion cost in this Chinese industry was 2.82% of the total production value.

​

Working conditions are highly variable according to the step to get valuable products. Usually, three main stages cover extracting oil and natural gas from the ground, transportation to the processing plant, and the conversion into finished or refined products. Such stages are the upstream, the midstream, and the downstream subsectors of the O&G industry—three very different stages, with many particularities concerning corrosion problems. Indeed, specific solutions, too. Looking at some of these answers is terrific. Then the invitation is to review some of the in-force patents about inventions related to anticorrosion measurements in the different subsectors.

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** Federal Service for Intellectual Property of the Russian Federation - ROSPATENT

**Patent No.:** 2366926C2

**Title:** *Detector of contamination and corrosion for control of production processes*

**Inventor (s):** Gregory S. Brown

**Applicant (s):** Rosemount Inc.

**Date of patent:** 10.09.2009

**Summary:** In this case, the invention is a simple device that is easy to install inside a pipeline which can provide information about the intensity and nature of corrosion or contamination in an adjacent asset. Variations in the quality and the attenuation coefficient of the resonant frequency response of the device, measured by piezoelectric principles, are associated with the deterioration occurring in the equipment of interest. The magnitude of the increase is used to indicate the degree and nature of corrosion or contamination. An alarm will be transmitted to the control center if the limit value is overpassed.

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** China National Intellectual Property Administration - CNIPA

**Patent No.:** 103238060B

**Title:** M*ethod and apparatus for measuring system parameters for mitigating corrosion in crude oil distillation units*

**Inventor (s):** Rodney H. Banks, Steven R. Jota, and Sasha Wirtz

**Applicant (s):** Nalco Corporation

**Date of patent:** 20.04.2016

**Summary:** Here again, we have found a device including a light source and an optical sensor for monitoring parameters linked to corrosion processes, such as pH, chlorides, or iron concentration. Measurements of absorbance and fluorescence are used to follow changes in optical properties like color, turbidity, or fluorescence of a working fluid added with some specific pH and other specific chemical concentration indicators fed from a boron-doped diamond electrolytic cell. Chemicals employed include bromcresol purple, fluorescein, p-Toluenesulfonic acid, phosphines, calcein blue, ferrozine, silver nitrate, thioglycol, ammonia, pH damping fluid, ferrous reductive agent, fluorescent dye, and lucigenin.

​**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** Canadian Intellectual Property Office - CIPO

**Patent No.:** 2868885C

**Title:** *Methods of removing a wellbore isolation device using galvanic corrosion*

**Inventor (s):** Michael L. Fripp, Syed Hamid, and Pete Dagenais

**Applicant (s):** Halliburton Energy Services Inc.

**Date of patent:** 28.11.2017

**Summary:** The described invention is concerned with applying corrosion principles to solve the technical duty of removing a wellbore isolation device. This procedure uses an isolation device like a ball and a seat type, comprising a galvanic couple, where a purposeful interaction with an electrolyte dissolves the anodic part. The electrodes of the designed corrosion cell are nuggets of materials like beryllium, tin, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, or graphite. The designed galvanic pair and the nature of the selected electrolyte determine the dissolution rate of the anodic part of the isolation device.

**Robotic dogs are here for helping industry asset protection**

A recent head in the *[newspapers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/26/robotic-dogs-taking-on-jobs-in-security-inspection-and-public-safety-.html)* concerned with the entrance of robotic dogs into surveillance duties and other activities related to control, prevention, security, safety, or even defense in charge of authorities elsewhere. According to *[Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/inspection-robots-market-A08254)*, the inspection robots market is another example of the post-globalization arrival, supported by the emerging technologies and fueled by the pandemic, the application of robots in such a kind of duties will be growing significantly in the coming years. The inspection robots market size was estimated at USD $940 million in 2020, and the Company’s projection is to reach almost USD $14.000 million by the end of the decade. But the more exciting applications of four legs robots, mobile robots, sometimes simulating dogs, are concerned with economic issues. The Corrosionists know very well how essential the inspection duties in our jobs are and how challenging, complex, hard, and risky they are, most of the time. We can remember the inspection of pipelines, boats, industrial plants, submerged installations, offshore platforms, large buildings, etc. Companies like *[BostonDynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/)* offer inspection possibilities, thorough, more straightforward, safer, and even cheaper. Their dogs for industrial inspection offer automated, remote, or hazardous inspections with different types of sensors for colorful visual inspection, gauge reading, thermal sensing, leak detection, infrared imaging, and laser scanning. The captured information can be automatically stored and processed, giving first-hand reports.

**Artificial Intelligence makes recycling easier**

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is effervescing. Another Corrosionists’ significant issue deals with the recycling of materials, mainly nowadays when one of the bolt recommendations about Circular Economy talks about the need for complete materials recycling as a condition of further development. *[AMP Robotics](https://www.amprobotics.com/)* is offering a valuable solution looking for an automatic identification categorization of waste streams, such as electronic scrap, or construction and demolition debris, by using an artificial intelligence platform fed with the supporting data, image registration cameras monitoring the waste, and a further sorting, picking and placing of materials according to their nature, color, size, brand, etc. According to AMP, benefits of this new technology are the opportunity to improve performance and reduce operating costs, increasing the value of the secondary resources, and improving the economics of recycling by:

* Avoiding costly rejections by validating contamination-free material for resale.
* Eliminating error-prone manual monitoring processes.
* Preventing system downtime by anticipating issues.
* Spotting hazards that could cause physical risks to staff.
* Identifying volume and material composition trends to optimize operations.
