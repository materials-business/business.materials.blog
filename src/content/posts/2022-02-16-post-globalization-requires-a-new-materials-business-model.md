# **Post-globalization requires a new materials business model**

​

Here, in MBW, we have spoken about the post-globalization arriving time, referring to the convergence of some shocking global facts over the last decades. We consider global warming, sustainability threats, the C-19 pandemic, socio-economical tensions, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. All those situations follow the line of Globalization established with the emergence, some decades ago, of the Knowledge Society and the Information Society. Related to such a kind of concern, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine – NASEM, USA, organized a workshop entitled “Materials Science and Engineering in a Post-Pandemic World: A *[DoD](https://www.defense.gov/)* Perspective.” Its proceedings were *[published](http://nap.edu/26226)* some weeks ago.

​

The starting point of the workshop was the consideration of the importance of advances in materials science and engineering for the US economy and national security, supported by the Triple Helix model of collaboration. A current concern directly related to the disruption in the education system, the nature of work, and the international linkages, included the broken global materials supply chain, among others, because of the C-19 pandemic and other threats facing the coming time. Without any doubt, a general concern valid for any other country, but also for every Corrosionists and other people involved with materials engineering handling.

​

The workshop included speakers and panelists from the US and abroad, from the academy, the government, professional societies, and industry. Discussed topics included approaches to the future of recruitment, teaching, training, research, university-industry-government partnership, innovation practices, internationalization, talent management, inclusiveness, and equity in materials science and engineering, at the school, the government, and the industry.

​\
As expected, several consequences of the pandemics were identified, such as the localization and regionalization of the supply chains. Also, were mentioned a list of negative and positive facts resulting from the global crisis generated with the SAR-CoV2. In the first place, there are included effects like shortages in manufacturing capabilities, logistics troubles, a sudden break in the education process, laboratory closures, disruption of research and significant drops in its productivity, exacerbation of existing workforce gaps, and declining government emphasis on non-medical R&D instead of prosperity purposes. On the other side, other aspects have been strengthened or developed, such as long-distance collaboration, increased papers published, innovative forms of remote recruitment, and onboard strategies with the consequent broadening of the talent pool.

​

Participants in the workshop put efforts into addressing future materials science and engineering needs. General recommendations about that included the need for an accelerated digitation and virtualization across workplaces and schools, with the corresponding transformation of the organizations, new forms of education and training of students, and retraining of the current personnel. Some of the specific recommendations looking for such goals include:

​

* To find an alternative to the 20th – century model of research and innovation looking for closing the nowadays inequity and inequality gaps.
* An increased emphasis on computational and data literacy, looking for:
* Multidisciplinary learning team-based and long-distance collaboration approach.
* To prioritize diversity and other innovative recruitment methods to improve the identification of successful professionals.
* A shift in the soft skills training, considering:
* To innovate in the academy-industry collaboration ways.

​

In the end, an exciting list of advice showing a pathway for materials science study, practice, and business aligned with the expectations and demands of a more suitable society on a more sustainable planet.

**A novel platform rocketing transfer knowledge to industry**

​*[NewSkin](https://www.newskin-oitb.eu/)* is a consortium funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, focused on establishing an open ecosystem fostering industrial innovation, specialty in SME, supported on advanced surface nanotechnologies. The consortium partners are companies, universities, and organizations from several sectors and countries interested in a faster translational impact of new coating research results on innovation and technology commercialization. Some of them are Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Uppsala University, TECHNION, Sirris, TECNALIA, Dream Cluster Water & Environment, the European Cluster of Ceramics, Kemica Coatings, Pulverit Polska, and APERAM. A portfolio of technologies, services, and resources, included testing capabilities, are being offered to the industry, including:

* A set of processes for the large-scale manufacturing of graphene nano-enabled membranes.
* Continuous laser texturing, roll to roll (R2R), and Texturing During Molding (TDM) nano-textures mass production processes.
* Pilot plant semi-industrial facilities.
* Continuous PVD and CVD processes.
* Validation and testing facilities
* Corporate funding, supply chain management, and access to market support.

**New materials, new possibilities**

In the same line of boosting the transference of the latest knowledge to the industrial production currents, *[ASM International](https://www.asminternational.org/home)* is endorsing a *[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeJ9q45PfD0)* produced by *[Veritasium](https://www.veritasium.com/)*, the science and engineering channel, about aerogels. They are considered the least dense solids ever existed, and the first reason is that aerogels are 99.8% air. Hence, a relevant property of such a kind of material is thermal insulation. Curiously, aerogels were first *[reported](https://www.nature.com/articles/127741a0)* by Prof. Samuel Kistler, more than 90 years ago. Some of their recent applications concerned critical conditions such as Mars missions and the Stardust comet particle-return mission. However, there are strong technical and economic limitations for broader use. But current research on a new generation of aerogels is opening new possibilities. Silica aerogel is characterized by a high specific surface area and a low dielectric constant, but *[research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.10.060)* on easier and cheaper ways of production is necessary to turn it out truly commercial. Durability and robustness are also challenging. Compositional variations become very promising, and as an example, a recent *[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.132989)* shows that a complex structure of polyacrylonitrile nanofibers impregnated with a functional polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), with conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) incorporated, and coated with hydrophobic octadecylamine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (ODA-rGO), achieves an elastic aerogel and a special self-cleaning ability for applications like oil/water separation and piezoresistive sensors.
