  That was a golden period of inventions. Soon, Others like Galileo Galilei
  improved the original design, and microscopy has become a new area of study,
  covering issues related to all nature, including living organisms and
  materials in general. It was the starting point of a list of microscopists,
  scientists using and improving the tool over the following centuries. For
  example, Robert Hooke, in England, in the 1660s, improved the microscope and
  published the book “Micrographia.” In the next decade, the Dutch Antoine van
  Leeuwenhoek designed a high-powered single-lens microscope to magnify up to
  270x. And some years later, pioneers of materials engineering started to
  report the use of the microscope for studying metals. Three hundred years ago,
  R.A. de Réaumur published a book about the nature of fracture patterns in iron
  and steel. Then, Henry Clifton Sorby, in the middle of the 19th century,
  developed the procedure for the metallographic samples preparation that we use
  even today (grinding, polishing, etching), which led to the scientific era in
  metallography. It was the beginning of the characterization of metals and
  alloy microstructure. Other researchers like W.C. Roberts-Austen, Adolf
  Martens, and L.J. Troost, all familiar names for metallurgists, contributed to
  Floris Osmond’s systematization in France and transforming metallography into
  sound science. Finally, at the beginning of the last century, the optical
  microscope reached its maximum physically possible development, resolving
  objects smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Such a barrier was
  solved with the invention of the transmission electron microscope by Ernst
  Ruska and his professor Max Knoll, in Germany, in 1931.


  During the 20th century, optical and electronic microscopes have been enhanced in fu


  techniques. These advances included the invention of the scanning electron microscope and an assortment of possibilities like fluorescent and polarized light; reflecting, phase contrast, confocal, ultraviolet, optical microscopes; and the environmental electron microscope. As always, new opportunities appeared with technological development. In the 1980s, the Third Industrial Revolution brought digitalization and microelectronics to support the invention of the scanning tunnel microscope and its derivate the atomic force microscope. Now, researchers had the answer to the old dream of watching atoms. Some of those outstanding contributions to scientific knowledge were acknowledged with the Nobel Prize:


  ● 1953 (Physics): Frits Zernike, phase contrast microscope.


  ● 1982 (Chemistry): Aaron Klug, crystallographic electron microscope.


  ● 1986 (Physics):


  ○ Ernst Ruska, electron microscope.


  ○ Gerd Binning and Heinrich Roher, scanning tunneling microscope.


  ● 2014 (Chemistry): Eric Betzig, Stefan W. Hell, and William E. Moerner, super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.


  ● 2017 (Chemistry): Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson, cryo-electron microscopy.


  Some of the above inventions can be related to one of the 14 Great Challenges for Engineering in the 21st

# **A unique tool for corrosion fighting**

**​**

**Clearing the darkness**

Darkness was most of the Earth for people incapable of imagining how the planet is, as happened for humankind until the proper development of ships joined to the spirit of risk of people like Chinese sailing the Pacific and Indic oceans some centuries ago. Also, Vikings were crossing the Atlantic. But also, explorers and leaders like Marco Polo, Cristobal Colon, and Hernando de Magallanes “weaving” the continents across the planet. Dark was the extraterrestrial space for all the people until the discoveries by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and other former astronomers that inventing and developing the telescope opened a window that currently we are trying to conquer. Dark is almost 85% of the universe. It is a matter that we cannot observe because it does not appear to absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic radiation. Therefore it cannot be seen using light. So then, dark is like a lack of knowledge about a portion of matter. Such a situation happened to the micro and the sub-micro world until the century 16th. But around 1600, the microscope was **[invented in Middleburg, The Netherlands](https://www.livescience.com/39649-who-invented-the-microscope.html)**. The instrument was a three-sliding tube with two or more different lenses, magnifying 3x to 9x. One of humankind's most important inventions and one of the most valuable innovations for Corrosionists’ job!

During the 20th century, optical and electronic microscopes have been enhanced in functionality and complementary techniques. These advances included the invention of the scanning electron microscope and an assortment of possibilities like fluorescent and polarized light; reflecting, phase contrast, confocal, ultraviolet, optical microscopes; and the environmental electron microscope. As always, new opportunities appeared with technological development.

Some of the above inventions can be related to one of the **[14 Great Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx)**, “Engineer the tools for scientific discovery,” promoted by the US National Association of Engineers. Moreover, many other recent improvements, now associated with real/digital integration, are characteristic of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. An evident example is a **[report](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2021.116987)**, some weeks ago, of advancement in the integration of deep learning as a tool for the automatic refocusing of blurred regions on the study of martensitic steels and precipitation-hardened alloys using STM. Right now, we are ready to see up to 10.000.000x and a lot of complementary options around, including tinting, qualitative and quantitative analyses, in-situ assessment, compositional determinations, three-dimensional imaging, in-live and computational analyses, and so on.

**Corrosionists use that tools**

Taking advantage of the above-described developments, corrosion studies are evolving, too, as has been **[shown](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2016.0414)** by Philippe Marcus and collaborators from his Research Group of Physical Chemistry of Surfaces of Institut de Recherche de Chimie Paris, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Paris. They have described a much better approach and understanding of the different places at the micro, nano, or sub nanoscale where the corrosion process is acting. E.g., the metal/electrolyte interface, the structure of the oxide passive films, localized corrosion at the nanoscale, including its origin (local passivity breakdown), local electronic properties of passive films, and, therefore, the atomistic modeling of corrosion employing the density functional theory. Sub nanometric changes occurring at the onset of the corrosive attack have been followed. Consequently, processes like the adsorption of the electrolyte on the metallic surface can be registered. Also, the initiation of the oxide growth and the step of the two to the three-dimension corrosion products film. And other passivation features such as the role of grain boundaries as preferential sites of dissolution where oxygen vacancies modify the surface density of state, promoting anionic transport and the Cl- entrance. Or instabilities of passive films resulting from the oxide growth mechanisms and the weak points from reasons as pre-oxidation. Similarly, approaches to investigate the effect and mechanisms of corrosion inhibitors and any other corrosive processes or anti-corrosive measurements occurring on any surface. Nowadays, we can say that corrosion engineering is evolving towards a more scientific discipline, closer to the required solutions in each case.

**Wind industry calls for Europe**

With the competitive process today, Europe's wind energy industry is actively engaged in reusing, recycling or recovering 100% of its abandoned blades, at the same time, the industry is committed not to send decommissioned blades from Europe to other countries outside of Europe for landfill.

Recycling circles were established for most components, including steel, cement, copper wire, electronics, and gears, however, wind turbine blades are more difficult to recycle. But their configuration also poses challenges for recycling, such composites are not only used in wind turbine blades. These are important materials in areas like aviation, automotive, marine transportation, aviation, recreational and sports equipment, construction, and construction.

​**Volvo to build steel cars without fossil fuels by 2026**

Volvo expects to produce carbon-free steel cars by 2026 under an agreement that could significantly reduce carbon emissions from the production of its vehicles, because steel is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, it is generally regarded as one of the most difficult to decarbonize. Volvo hopes to use it in a concept car by 2025, with commercial applications arriving by 2026 at the earliest. Kerstin Enochsson, Volvo’s head of procurement said it was too early to say what impact the new technology would have on car prices but added that the carmaker considered environmental sustainability as a key part of its attractiveness to buyers.
