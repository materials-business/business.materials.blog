# **Modeling, simulation, and prediction pay**

**​**

**​**

**A permanent challenge**

​\
Prediction of material behavior has always been a severe problem for Corrosionists. It has been an issue of business and a concern about safety, health, aesthetics, and other reasons concerning corrosion prevention and protection. The heuristic method of engineering lets us use empirical knowledge to solve these types of challenges, which was the way initially. However, more precise estimates, with the least possible uncertainty, have always been needed, and predicting corrosion behavior has become increasingly scientific. Simulation by physical modeling has been a helpful tool for corrosion studies. Most of the works developed in the lab deal with the simulation of authentic situations but under controlled conditions. This means that some known variables are fixed while the remainders are systematically tracked (usually, there are unknown, uncontrolled variables, too). Experimental simulation is based on the scientific method, and the results are just an approach to the actual field situation. Nonetheless, simulation is a simplification, and real cases are complex, as the world is. Theoretical modeling has been a complementary tool, trying to solve limitations as accurate control of variables and cost and time-consumption requirements in simulation experiments. Modeling is a mathematical approach to any situation, and this is one of its more substantial facts. Quality of modeling depends on the initially given information, almost always empirical, with all the risks that such information carries and the degree of adjustment of the mathematical tool to the fact under consideration.

​\
The quality of information available to any modeling tool has improved as the science and technology of corrosion have evolved. A better understanding of each situation, the materials and environments involved, and the way they interact are essential for better information supporting modeling and, consequently, much better results and predictions. Also, factors like the nature of the corrosion products are relevant as part of the information for modeling corrosion and anticorrosion situations.

​\

​**Valuable tools**

​\
In the beginning, mathematical equations were the best way to predict corrosion behavior, either by interpolation among known situations or extrapolating beyond these. Thus, linear processes like iron corrosion in strong acids, where corrosion products go away immediately, can be modeled. Besides, phenomena like atmospheric corrosion of engineering alloys (Fe, Cu, Al, and Zn) behavior are not linear, and, instead, equations as bi-logarithmic have been applied successfully many times. Equations that try to adjust to the thermodynamic and kinetic features happening in real situations. For example, some equations distinguish corrosive attack at the beginning of exposure from progression afterward. Many studies have been reported in the literature, including equations predicting the behavior of several building materials deduced from specific sites across the planet in particular periods. Yet there are no universal equations, valid wherever and whenever. Fortunately, more advanced mathematical tools than the simpler equations have been developed and applied to better model corrosion processes. These are statistical methods, including conceptual, analytical, probability-based, and knowledge-based models. In particular, the last ones have been applied to **[corrosion studies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2009.06.004)**. Knowledge-based modeling approaches have evolved from the last decades of the twentieth century to the powerful tool today, named machine learning – ML, as a prominent constituent of the Artificial Intelligence tools. ML is one of the radical innovations shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In such a condition, it is possible to solve more complex, multi-objective problems. Some of the essential methods available today that must be considered by Corrosionists dealing with the prediction of the corrosion phenomena includes Markov chains, Monte Carlo simulation, grey relational analysis, artificial neural networks, and its several derivate methods, support vector regression, expert systems, fuzzy logic, genetic models, and, obviously, machine learning where the previous methods merge. A plethora of options are often combinable or complementary and may be considered depending on the requirements of a situation and the possibilities of data processing.

​\
On the other side, it is crucial to consider adding different approaches to the corrosion studies. Future corrosion and anticorrosion engineering must pass through a more multidisciplinary and complex approach. For example, corrosion processes, including the flow of fluids, such as weather or ocean situations, water flow in a pipe, airflow around a building, etc., can be studied by mechanics of fluids. So, modeling with equations like the Navier-Stokes could be very useful because it is possible to handle variables such as temperature and pollutants distribution.

​

In all the cases, numerical techniques such as finite element method, finite difference method, boundary element method, and computational fluids dynamics are helpful for processing vast amounts of data. In addition, recent improvements in computing capability open a new horizon for computationally intensive modeling options. Currently, supercomputers are available for processing enormous amounts of information in a relatively short time. Besides, quantum computers are being developed. They will achieve instantaneous calculations that would take hundreds of millions of years to complete in a supercomputer.

​\
Corrosion and anticorrosion engineering must become increasingly scientific and less empirical. The prediction of the behavior of materials and industrial assets must use the most advanced mathematical tools. That is why the simulation, modeling, and prediction of corrosion phenomena must increasingly be based on tools such as ML. An adequate prediction avoids loss of money, leakages of pollutants, fires, the collapse of buildings, and so on. Any one of them justifies the efforts of the Corrosionists using the best tools at their fingertips.

**Opportunity of taking advantage of the European atmospheric test sites infrastructure**

**​**

Thanks to the efforts of the WP25 Atmospheric Corrosion group of the European Federation of Corrosion, coordinated by colleagues Tomas Prosek and Johan Tiblad, the first edition of a catalog of atmospheric corrosion field exposure sites in Europe is now available. Altogether, 43 sites are described in the Catalogue covering all types of environments (rural, urban, industrial, marine, and high UV), different climatic zones (from Athens to the north of Norway), levels of industrial pollution, chloride deposition, humidity, and, of course, corrosivity. For example, the yearly corrosion rate per square meter for copper ranges from 0.6 g·in Katowice, Poland, to 89 g in Helgoland, Germany, covering the whole scale of corrosivity categories from C1 to CX as defined in ISO 9223. Each site is carefully described in terms of geographical location, nature, length of operation, corrosivity, environmental parameters, type of available exposure racks and space, and contact details. The main aim of the Catalogue is to help industry and researchers find sites with required conditions for outdoor corrosion tests and provide a general overview of what is available. The Catalogue is available free of charge at:

​**The steel industry is required to amortize up to $70 billion in assets if it continues to rely on coal**

**​**

According to the International Energy Agency, the global steel industry needs to cut emissions from 2019 levels by more than half by 2050 to meet Paris Agreement targets. Caitlin Swalec, the lead author of the report, added that: “Based on projections from the IEA and other groups, most likely by 2030-2040. It could be sooner if more aggressive carbon taxes or restrictions are enforced ”. According to the report, steelmakers have pledged to shift to net zero and low carbon emissions that cover more than three-quarters of the current global steel capacity.

Companies in the sector are considering electric arc furnaces while developing hydrogen and carbon capture technologies to reduce emissions.

**Strengthening the EU aerospace industry by optimizing design for inspection**

**​**

Non-destructive assessment techniques based on ultrasound, energy harvesting, and wireless sensor networks are increasingly effective in monitoring damage in aerospace. However, there is an urgent need to integrate these approaches and techniques from the design of an aircraft. To integrate these approaches and meet future challenges, the COST action: Optimizing Design for Inspection, launched in 2019, has established a network of leading European experts in several key areas to develop an integrated framework for Optimized auto-detection structures capable of diagnosis and prognosis. In this context, the action has effectively established an interdisciplinary network of mechanical and electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, materials science of 29 countries. They aim to connect researchers in academia, including early career researchers and industry, who share a vision of delivering safer and greener aerospace travel.
