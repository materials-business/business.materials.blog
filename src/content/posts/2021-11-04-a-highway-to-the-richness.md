description: ​In principle, we are talking about innovation from countries
  different than the First World. Or the “Group of Eight,” including France,
  Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Russia (withdrew
  in 2017), and The European Union (“non-enumerated” member). A group with
  approximately 1,200 million people and more than 46 percent of the world's
  nominal gross domestic product. Richness is proportional to R&D, knowledge
  generation, technology development, innovation, and patents. On the opposite
  side, when you read this writing, there will be over 6.600 million people, 85%
  of the global population, in the rest of the countries, most of them poor or
  developing countries. A group of about 200 countries searching for their
  development, some of them supported on innovation. This is the so-called
  “reverse innovation” (very different from reverse engineering) because the new
  goods and services, thus produced in emerging markets, are exported to the
  developed ones. Inventions counterflow, moving from the “periphery” to the
  “metropolis.” This is the case of recent inventions, all closely related to
  the current significant global threats to greener development by alternative
  energy sources and waste beneficiation. Three South American inventions, two
  Colombian and one more from Peru. All of them were recently patented.

# **From The Editor's Corner**

# **A highway to the richness**



Famous in the 1960s were the words cheap, ordinary, low quality, copying. Just the qualifying adjectives to speak about Japanese products. However, 30 years later, the adjectives moved in the opposite direction: expensive, refined, high-quality, and original. But in the 1990s, I avoided buying a Daewoo car because South Korean products were recognized as the Japanese after WWII, including the label of imitation. ***[Right now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_South_Korea)***, “The automotive industry in South Korea is the fifth-largest in the world as measured by automobile unit production and also the sixth-largest by automobile export volume.” But in not more than the last ten years, China has been moving in the same direction. We are talking about three of the more recognized patent offices globally, joining together with the USA, the European Union, and the World International Patent Office. ***[Figures](https://www3.wipo.int/ipstats/index.htm?tab=patent)*** about applications at the Chinese Patents Office shows that they were 10.137 in 1990 (around three times the applications in Spain, or 1% of the ***[applications worldwide](https://www.statista.com/topics/3847/global-patents-and-ip/#dossierKeyfigures)***); 51.906 in 2000; 399.177 in 2010; and 1.400.661 in 2019 (almost one thousand times the applications in Spain for the same year, or 43.4% of the ***[global applications](https://www.statista.com/topics/3847/global-patents-and-ip/#dossierKeyfigures)***). In conclusion, there is a pathway to industrial development related to the world of patents. Of course, the evolution of the weight of the countries mentioned in the world economy is unnecessary here. In addition, recent news suggests that India could begin the same way. Last month, the Indian government decided to encourage patenting. It announced an 80% fee cut for educational institutions, looking for fostering research, a closer collaboration between the Triple Helix University – Industry – Government, and as a result, a more competitive national economy.

In principle, we are talking about innovation from countries different than the First World. Or the “Group of Eight,” including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Russia (withdrew in 2017), and The European Union (“non-enumerated” member). A group with approximately 1,200 million people and more than 46 percent of the world's nominal gross domestic product. Richness is proportional to R&D, knowledge generation, technology development, innovation, and patents. On the opposite side, when you read this writing, there will be over 6.600 million people, 85% of the global population, in the rest of the countries, most of them poor or developing countries. A group of about 200 countries searching for their development, some of them supported on innovation. This is the so-called “***[reverse innovation](https://tatacenter.mit.edu/2015/07/01/reverse-innovation-why-it-fails-and-how-it-can-succeed/)***” (very different from reverse engineering) because the new goods and services**,** thus produced in emerging markets, are exported to the developed ones. Inventions counterflow, moving from the “periphery” to the “metropolis.” This is the case of recent inventions, all closely related to the current significant global threats to greener development by alternative energy sources and waste beneficiation. Three South American inventions, two Colombian and one more from Peru. All of them were recently patented.

**Synthesis of high-purity magnetite.** Sogamoso, the “city of the Sun and Steel,” a small town 230 km to the North of Bogota, is the place of some ironmaking plants and the venue of the awarded invention. As usual, thousands of tons of mill scale are produced monthly. But an exciting sustainable and economical solution has been patented, directed to obtain a product with high added value, high-purity magnetite, and contributing to one of the current primary purposes of global industry, as greener steelmaking process is. Here, we have an invention about taking advantage of rust as the corrosion product of ferrous alloys.

​

**A disruptive source of electricity.** This is the nature of the patent awarded to a young Peruvian student of Civil Engineering, involved with solutions for the poorest communities in the Andean Mountains of his country. A patent about electricity from bacteria and plants is kept in a clay container made with local raw materials and following indigenous procedures. For example, the system can provide energy to rural residents in non-interconnected and apart regions. But cheaper and more sustainable than conventional sources. Without any doubt, an exciting subject concerning energy sources for cathodic protection in remote areas and indeed other anticorrosive applications.

**Optimization of solar cells.** With the pleasure that they were students of the editor and ***[close](https://news.materials.business/26/01/2021/solar-photovoltaics-in-the-global-transition)*** to MBW, the last patent curated today concerns a priority subject nowadays and, consequently, a relevant contribution to the international current of scientific knowledge about more, cheaper, and highly efficient ways of solar energy production. After all the rigorous assessments by the US Patents Office, this is an application that must be published as a patent in force next week.

​**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

**Patent granter:** World Intellectual Property Organization - WIPO

**Patent No.:** WO2021002764

**Title:** *Device for generating electrical energy from bacterial species, plants and solar panels with a cooling system*

**Inventor (s):** Hernán Asto Cabezas

**Applicant (s):** Hernán Asto Cabezas

**Date of patent:** 07.01.2021

**Summary:** Applicants have been granted a patent related to the invention of a device for generating electricity thanks to the biogenic activity of some electrogenic bacterial strains (Shewanellaceae and Bacillaceae species) and a tuberous root plant from the asparagus family, in a substrate of soil including compost, hummus, and black earth. Both plant and bacteria act as electron sources. In addition, at least a small solar panel, oriented according to the latitude, is included. All the three essential components are integrated into a particular geometric shape, a ceramic reservoir made with a mixture of red-brown clay (50%), reddish-yellow color clay (20%), white color clay (20%), and pozzolana (10%). Furthermore, a circuit of electrodes and an energy storage device connected to the solar panels are included.

​

Australia is on the cusp of an unprecedented wave of investment in public infrastructure projects, with investment in key public infrastructure over the next five years across the Country exceeding USD $164.000 million. The scale of investment and the growth rate to achieve it is unprecedented. This is an essential support for the understanding of the required skills, because 34 of the 50 public infrastructure occupations are potentially in shortage, and the projects to be developed, including supplies as equipment, materials, and technologies, as guidelines for companies dealing with the development of the Country.
