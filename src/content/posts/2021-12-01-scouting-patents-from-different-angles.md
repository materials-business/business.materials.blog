description: The world of patents is fascinating, full of knowledge, but many
  times it is so complicated that you need the support of lawyers to try to
  understand it. Enchanting is to know that 91 years ago, on 11.11.1930, there
  was awarded a patent for the invention of a kind of the refrigerator to Albert
  Einstein and his colleague the Hungarian physics and Professor in the
  metallurgical laboratory at the University of Chicago, Leo Szilard. This is an
  excellent example that basic science, applied science, technological
  development, and innovation do not compete. Instead, they should be as
  complementary as possible. Today, we can enjoy remembering such an invention,
  which patent expired on 11.11.1947, about a simple way of having a
  refrigerator. An apparatus invented to meet the needs of ancient times, but
  supported in the principles and knowledge currently available for anyone who
  wants to exploit them, and even valid for the needs of the current global
  warming time and the new industry requirements.

The world of patents is fascinating, full of knowledge, but many times it is so complicated that you need the support of lawyers to try to understand it. Enchanting is to know that 91 years ago, on 11.11.1930, there was awarded a patent for the invention of a kind of the refrigerator to Albert Einstein and his colleague the Hungarian physics and Professor in the metallurgical laboratory at the University of Chicago, Leo Szilard. This is an excellent example that basic science, applied science, technological development, and innovation do not compete. Instead, they should be as complementary as possible. Today, we can enjoy remembering such an invention, which patent expired on 11.11.1947, about a simple way of having a refrigerator. An apparatus invented to meet the needs of ancient times, but supported in the principles and knowledge currently available for anyone who wants to exploit them, and even valid for the needs of the current global warming time and the new industry requirements.

**Fertilizing the ground for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.**

​

Also, it is good to remember that the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2000, was awarded to Profs. Heeger and MacDiarmid from USA, and Prof. Shirikawa from Japan “for the discovery and development of electrically conductive polymers.” This recognition was based on extensive research carried out in numerous laboratories since the 1970s. Some of the synthesized polymers included poly(dialkylfluorene), poly(pyrrole), poly(thiophene), etc. Many of the expected applications were confirmed later, including cell phone displays, video matrix displays, and light - emitting diodes - LED, battery items, and functional coatings for sensing devices. Furthermore, certain developments have made it possible to find solution to several corrosion problems. One of the best options was found with doped polyaniline, which one used as polymeric film is useful for electromagnetic shielding of electronic circuits and as a corrosion inhibitor. This is the subject matter of an expired patent granted in 1997 to protect an invention involving an anti-corrosive polyaniline film coating. To learn about this invention and to have the option of using such knowledge is a great opportunity today.

**Searching answers to the post-globalization challenges.**

​

In the end, it is interesting to look at recent ***[newspaper headlines](https://optionstradingreport.com/2021/10/nippon-steel-sues-toyota-baoshan-for-patent-infringement/)***. The Japanese company Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., the world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker by output, has decided to file a patent infringement lawsuit against the also Japanese Toyota Motors and China’s Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. (Baosteel). The demanding steelmaker as for a compensation of USD $352.52 million. In addition, it seeks a ban on the manufacture of Toyota cars using any patent-related steel that underlies the claim. This is an apparent patent violation about a new generation of steel developed explicitly for the decarbonization of the transport sector—a fascinating invention from the metallurgical and anticorrosive point of view.

**Expired exclusivity**

**Patent granter:** US Patent & Trademark Office - USPTO

**Patent No.:** 1781541

**Title:** *Refrigeration*

**Author (s):** Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard

**Applicant (s):** Electrolux Servel Corp

**Priority date:** 16.12.1927

**Summary:** The patented invention concerns a method of refrigerating by a fully closed-loop procedure happening in the corresponding invented apparatus. Only a few parts (generator, condenser, evaporator, conduits, and a container) operate with butane, ammonia, and water according to some basic chemical and thermodynamic principles of phase changes and separation, specific gravity, solubility, vapor pressure, and gravity force.

**Expired exclusivity**

**Patent granter:** US Patent & Trademark Office - USPTO

**Patent No.:** 5645890A

**Title:** *Prevention of corrosion with polyaniline*

**Author (s):** Alan G. MacDiarmid and Naseer Ahmad

**Applicant (s):** The University of Pennsylvania and US Navy

**Priority date:** 05.06.1995

**Summary:** An invention about developing a polyaniline film, polymerized from the inexpensive aniline, to be applied as a coating on steel surfaces as an inhibitor of the corrosive attack. The polyaniline as emeraldine basic oxidation state form, (\[C6H4NH]2\[C6H4N]2)n, is dissolved in an organic solvent (a mixture of N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethyl sulphoxide, and tetramethylurea) before application by spraying on the steel previously treated with phosphoric acid and a chelating agent like alizarin sulfonic acid or chromotropic acid. Then, the solvent is evaporated, leaving the polyaniline film protecting the substrate. Non-conducting and conductive doped polyaniline can be used to protect against corrosion.

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** Japan Patent Office – JPO

**Patent No.:** 2017193754

**Title:** *Non-oriented electromagnetic steel sheet for straight moving iron core, manufacturing method therefore and straight moving iron core*

**Inventor (s):** Ryutaro Kawamata, Tesshu Murakawa, and Masahiro Fujikura.

**Applicant (s):** Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal

**Date of patent:** 11.03.2020

**Summary:** The granted patent deal with a non-oriented electromagnetic low Si-Mg-Ni alloy steel and its manufacture method, including hot and cold rolling, annealing, and pickling, resulting in a novel microstructure with a preferred orientation of the magnetization axis. A new 0.5 mm thick steel sheet can be used to produce straight moving iron cores of electric linear motor cars, where a high magnetic flux is in the plate surface and at the plate end, even in the magnetic field in which the direction of magnetic flux changes are required.

​[Understand your varnish to combat it](https://www.chevronlubricants.com/content/dam/external/industrial/en_us/sales-material/brochures/VARTECH_Brochure.pdf)**​

​

Varnish is formed when high operating temperatures deplete protective additives, causing the lubricant to oxidize and break down. Water, chemicals, particles, gasses, and other contaminants also act to degrade the oil. Elements of this degradation, known as varnish precursors, precipitate out of the oil and attach themselves to internal surfaces. The tacky nature of these deposits attracts more and more precursors and varnish builds up layer by layer, Chevron develop a new system cleaner called VARTECH Industrial System Cleaner (ISC) utilizes proprietary technology to do the most thorough and efficient cleaning job without creating operational constraints.

​

Ford and Lincoln technicians have been working on tech can view resources and instructions shared by the trained team on the headset's display while keeping both hands working on the repair. Ford Motor Company is the first US domestic one to adopt this technology, to reduce vehicle downtime. This practice increase customer satisfaction scores and reduce technician diagnostic time on complicated repairs.

Saudi Arabia announced its latest ambitious project, an eight-sided city that would float on the Red Sea, NEOM is the brainchild of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the flagship project of his 13-year plan to modernize the conservative kingdom, dubbed "Vision 2030." Neom is funded by the kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Neom is a reimagined industrial city, now open for materials business.
