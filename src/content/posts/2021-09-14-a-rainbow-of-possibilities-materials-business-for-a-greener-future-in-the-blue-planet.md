  Right now, one year after the launching of Materials.Business Weekly, it is

  concern at post-globalization when environmental, socio-economic, and health
  pressures converge simultaneously with the fourth industrial revolution. There
  are approaches to the problems, but mainly to the solutions in the hands of
  our specialty, fixing the criterion of a problem like a challenge and the fuel
  for innovation (another buzzy word for most people). CE has been referred to
  many times previously as a means of sustainable development. Consequently, it
  is an excellent time to dive deeper into this topic.

  ​


  CE is presented in contrast to the traditional and straightforward economic development, including extraction of resources, production of assets, use, and discarding them fast. CE is a new business strategy oriented towards sustainable socio-economic development. CE is more than a simple “green” or “blue” economy, where good means more expensive. Of course, CE puts profit as a clear goal. Still, it is just a new different model of business, new models of business plans, not only a product or service, a business model intrinsically including a proper social/environmental added-value. CE implies the redefinition of growth with new economic models and new business models. A regenerative economy ideally without waste. Economical, natural, and social capitals based on design strategies, keep in use, and regeneration—a new logic of competitiveness including public good as part of the new metrics. The new CE model focuses on the fact that resources are scarce and finite, and achievements can be provided at the design stage. It is imperative to hold materials in use, long-term life products must be a trend, redistribution is a new business opportunity, and remanufacturing a valuable industrial activity.



  ​


  In addition, the above expectations could have a strong and negative effect mainly on emerging economies because of the changes in the mineral markets, the mining industry, and the loss of employment. In addition, actions to capitalize on new opportunities include government policies and public and private funds that support education and research and development programs. Awareness campaigns about the CE’s importance, challenges, and chances. Re-skilling of workers for the CE businesses. Industrial reconversion (e.g., biomimetism, urban mining, etc.) and operation (e.g., policies of waste extended producer responsibility- EPR, recycling conditioned by added-value, etc.). Proper entrepreneurial ecosystems. Working collaboratively across value chains and clusters. Stronger cooperation through models like the Triple Helix cooperation University-Industry-Government. And tools or meeting points like “Circular” technology parks. In the end, a vast platform of radical innovations supports a new core of the business based on the CE.

​

**A nervous excitement**

​\
​There is a powerful reason for it! The existence of planet Earth is not threatened, but that of our species is. Consequently, the term sustainable development has become trendy today. In addition, others like OSD and Circular Economy – CE -are becoming buzz terms. And this is a significant risk if the subjects are salient because many speeches, documents, and agreements appear, but actions are scarce. These days, nature warnings are multiplying, and practical responses are a duty. In front of this panorama, Corrosionists are called to act promptly and contribute to finding the pathway of a sustainable planet for future generations.

​\
​

Right now, one year after the launching of Materials.Business Weekly, it is essential to explicitly recognize our convincement on the importance of such a nervous wave. Most of the editorials published here each week reflect our concern at post-globalization when environmental, socio-economic, and health pressures converge simultaneously with the fourth industrial revolution. There are approaches to the problems, but mainly to the solutions in the hands of our specialty, fixing the criterion of a problem like a challenge and the fuel for innovation (another buzzy word for most people). CE has been referred to many times previously as a means of sustainable development. Consequently, it is an excellent time to dive deeper into this topic.

​\
​

CE is presented in contrast to the traditional and straightforward economic development, including extraction of resources, production of assets, use, and discarding them fast. CE is a new business strategy oriented towards sustainable socio-economic development. CE is more than a simple “green” or “blue” economy, where good means more expensive. Of course, CE puts profit as a clear goal. Still, it is just a new different model of business, new models of business plans, not only a product or service, a business model intrinsically including a proper social/environmental added-value. CE implies the redefinition of growth with new economic models and new business models. A regenerative economy ideally without waste. Economical, natural, and social capitals based on design strategies, keep in use, and regeneration—a new logic of competitiveness including public good as part of the new metrics. The new CE model focuses on the fact that resources are scarce and finite, and achievements can be provided at the design stage. It is imperative to hold materials in use, long-term life products must be a trend, redistribution is a new business opportunity, and remanufacturing a valuable industrial activity.

​\
​

One of the entities leading the wave is the ***[Ellen MacArthur Foundation](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/)***, which primary purpose is to accelerate the transition towards a CE. But now, many other NGOs, companies, universities, and some governments are cooperating in the same sense. For example, the European Commission has made CE its development model and launched its Circular Economy Action Plan – ***[CEAP](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en)*** – last year, as a basis of the “European Green Deal.” By your side, the World Economic Forum WEF – in a partnership with some multinational companies-promotes several actions. One of these is the **“*[Circular Accelerator](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-issue/a002o0000133k1kAAA/the-circulars-accelerator-22?utm_term=Apply%20now&utm_id=6919&utm_campaign=UpLink%20Weekly%20-%202%20September&utm_medium=email&sfmc_id=1591936&utm_source=sfmc)*,**” intended to bring together global public and private sector experts dedicated to innovation in EC's emerging challenges. Here are funding sources open for all, included Corrosionists looking for new solutions in front of the CE. In another way, the Global Circular Economy Network – CEC - or the ***[CE club](https://www.circulareconomyclub.com/)***, is a non-profit arm of the Circular Economy Institute – ***[CEI](https://ceinstitute.org/)*** – supporting cities setting the end of the waste age. Currently, CEC members are over 280 local clubs of professionals and organizations in 140 countries.

​\
​

One more sign of the current excitement is publishing a new scientific journal by Springer Nature, labeled “***[Materials Circular Economy](https://www.springer.com/journal/42824)*.**” According to the editors, this new journal is a platform for scientists and engineers*,* publishing in sustainable materials, life cycle engineering, lifecycle assessment, and the 6R strategies (reuse, recycle, redesign, remanufacture, and recover) under the umbrella of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

​\
​

Events are more and more recurrent. ***[RACE](https://www.raceconferences.com/)*** (Recycling and the Circular Economy) Conferences is a global platform that hosts meetings on the subject. Last July 15th and 16th organized the Asia meeting of its 4th RACE conference, with the motto “Global waste epidemic – Recycling- A change enabler.” Right now, RACE is inviting to attend the Americas and Europe-related meetings to behold on October 8th and 9th of 2021 and January 20th and 21st of 2022, respectively. In the same direction, the** *[Climate Group](https://www.theclimategroup.org/)***, a network of over 300 multinational companies worldwide, in a partnership with the United Nations General Assembly and the City of New York, is arranging “Climate Week NYC 2021, to behold on September 20th to 26th of 2021. The main goal of Climate Week NYC 2021 is to showcase leading climate action and discuss how to do more and faster as a readiness effort towards the coming United Nations Climate Change Conference 2026. Furthermore, the International Network for Government Science Advice – ***[INGSA](https://www.ingsa.org/)*** – hosts its annual congress’s satellite workshop, named “Raw Materials Challenge – Policy simulation.” A workshop organized by the ***[Center for Systems Solutions](https://systemssolutions.org/)*** and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis – ***[IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/)*** - aimed at debating an issue directly related to the challenges of corrosionists: How possible is extracting critical minerals staying within ecological and social limits?. The right question in the middle of such nervous post-globalization time!

​\
​\
​**An essential condition for business**

​

As part of the same valuable wave, last 18th and 19th of August of 2021 was held a ***[Global Summit on Circular Economy](https://cumbremec.cordoba.gob.ar/)***, hosted by the Municipality of Cordoba, Argentina. This was a hybrid event with thousands of attendants who had the opportunity to listen to speeches from entities like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the CEI, the World Bank, the ***[CE Club of Singapore](https://www.circulareconomyclub.com/location/singapore/)***, and the ***[Central American Bank for Economic Integration](https://www.bcie.org/en/)***, but also the well-recognized leader of the economic transition like ***[Gunter Pauli](https://www.gunterpauli.com/)*** and Peter Heck from the Institute of Applied Material Flow Management of the Trier University of Applied Science in Birkenfeld, Germany. A key finding entirely agrees with the need to speed up the transition from theory to practice. Besides, some of the presentations emphasized actual opportunities, many of them directly concerning the role of Corrosionists facing the challenges of CE. Learning from the lecturers and qualifying with information from some other relevant sources, it is possible to say that the potential benefits of the CE globally include:

​\
​

​● It is ***[expected](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057%2F978-1-349-95968-6)*** a USD $4,500.000 million market opportunity by 2030.

​● More than USD $1.000 million of savings in materials.

​● More than 15 million new jobs in 15 years.

​● Reusing more than 100 million tons of steel in 2025 with an expected drop of 6% in the price as a countermeasure against higher prices because of reactivation and less availability of raw materials.

​● To avoid more than 1 million tons CO2 emissions by reuse and remanufacturing of cell phones.

​\
​

In addition, the above expectations could have a strong and negative effect mainly on emerging economies because of the changes in the mineral markets, the mining industry, and the loss of employment. In addition, actions to capitalize on new opportunities include government policies and public and private funds that support education and research and development programs. Awareness campaigns about the CE’s importance, challenges, and chances. Re-skilling of workers for the CE businesses. Industrial reconversion (e.g., ***[biomimetism](https://news.materials.business/17/08/2021/a-world-of-knowledge-sources-for-asset-protection)***, ***[urban mining](http://www.cimeliaglobal.com/)***, etc.) and operation (e.g., policies of waste extended producer responsibility- ***[EPR](https://www.oecd.org/environment/waste/Extended-producer-responsibility-Policy-Highlights-2016-web.pdf)***, recycling conditioned by added-value, etc.). Proper entrepreneurial ecosystems. Working collaboratively across value chains and clusters. Stronger cooperation through models like the Triple Helix cooperation University-Industry-Government. And tools or meeting points like “Circular” technology parks. In the end, a vast platform of radical innovations supports a new core of the business based on the CE.

​\
​

In a more systematic, although less specific way, we can find a broad portfolio of opportunities in a European Commission report that highlights a set of enterprises associated with the CE. The system includes four kinds of models, grouping a total of 14 business models. Three of the models deal with design and production, use, and recovery. As expected, many of the advised new business fields are directly linked to the Corrosionists’ duties. Specifically, new business opportunities concerning design and production, fostering CE by a long-term value retention aim, including higher resource efficiency, better materials, optimization of the usage of the materials (each material in its right place), more extended durability included anticorrosive measurements, more reuse based on smarter protection, repair opportunities established from the design and guarantee with corrosion prevention and protection, higher recyclability (where dealloying is a severe issue), and proper disposal, if necessary. In addition, the development and deployment of new processes and materials and the use of secondary raw materials and by-products. Here, the EU suggests actions related to reverse logistics of wastes, as redundant products, parts, and materials; recovery of materials from waste and their subsequent valorization. As with the commitment to innovate to stay in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it happens with the pledge to the strategies of the CE as a condition to be successful in the post-globalization era.

​\
​\
​**It's the Corrosionists´ age**

​

One recent news concerning answers against the challenges for materials engineers in the frame of the CE strategy was the ***[manufacture of low-cost Ti wire](https://www.csiro.au/en/work-with-us/ip-commercialisation/Marketplace/titanium-wire)*** from scrap by additive manufacturing. It is just an example of the contribution to the ***[9% circularity of the global economy today](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057%2F978-1-349-95968-6)***. Thinking about the traditional role of Corrosionists, we can say that by nature, Corrosionists are devoted to the CE. However, traditionally we have moved in the linear economy. Right now, under the guidelines of the CE, a systematic response is required of Corrosionists, including solutions and contributions to the several ***[loops and steps](https://www.materialsperformance.com/articles/corrosion-basics/2021/02/a-circular-economy-approach-from-a-corrosion-engineer)*** as described by the Helen McArthur Foundation in the establishment of the CE branch concerning materials and energy usage looking for the most extended long term cycle of usage as possible, and entailing a holistic design for purpose as starting point:

​\
​

​● Materials procurement: Corrosion prevention by design.

​● Processing towards useful products: Corrosion prevention by design and materials selection.

​● Usage: Life extension, deep understanding of the operating conditions, fitness for service, the safety performance of critical elements, optimal inspection and maintenance intervals, and circular anticorrosive measurements.

​● Reuse: Intelligent allocation with preventive criteria and anticorrosive protection measurements.

​● Decommissioning: Planned from conception and executed under the criteria of zero waste.

​● Remanufacturing: Proper preventive design.

​● Recycling: By procedures in agreement with the proper required new materials.

​● Abandonment: Corrosion control and prevention seeking any pollution risk.

​\
​

In summary, never, opportunities for Corrosionists have been better than on the CE strategy that has been promoted as the only way to guarantee the Earth planet for our descendants. Big problems are significant opportunities, and this is ours.
