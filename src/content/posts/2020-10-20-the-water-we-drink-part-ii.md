# **THE WATER WE DRINK - PART II**

Life is water and good life is good water. Then, water availability has been a permanent concern for humankind, and specifically, one of the big challenges of engineering. It was at the beginning of the times, it is right now, and it will be in the coming times. Materials for handling water are essential, but water is "The Corrosive" by excellence. Corrosion and protection of materials handling drinking water are a big duty at every corner of the globe. Currently, water safety is a very serious concern in the Seoul Metropolitan area because of rusty water and larvae presence. The same in Busan and other Korean cities. It is a problem of national concern. Surely, there are such kinds of problems in many other places worldwide. Knowledge about materials to be used as part of the drinking water systems is basic. Also, a deep understanding of materials behavior under specific conditions and the development of new solutions are current and coming duties for corrosionists.

​

**Materials with which drinking water is supplied**

Further than ancient materials mentioned above as aqueduct constituents (pipes, valves, gauges, fittings, seals, etc.), there is a broad fan of options, including whole the big families: metallic, ceramic, polymeric, composite, complex, and mixtures of some of them. As usual, selection depends on technical (pressure, velocity, corrosiveness, etc.) and economy specifications, defined by designers in each case, at each time. Also, the selection depends on the requirements as the main piping subsystem, distribution, or service lines, finally supplying water to the consumers. Non-metallic materials employed for pipes include ceramic and polymeric options as stoneware, concrete, asbestos (currently forbidden), PVC, glass-fiber reinforced polyester (GRP). Usually, corrosion resistance is good. Technical limitations are mainly related to a poor combination of mechanical properties (mechanical resistance, and toughness). As an answer, metallic parts show good mechanical properties, but corrosion resistance is markedly lower. Some of the most common metallic materials employed in pipelines include:

​

**Mild steel.** An optimum from the mechanical perspective, but with extremely low corrosion resistance.

**Gray iron.** Commonly used in distribution networks during the first half of the 20th Century. Something special to highlight in it is that gray is prone to “graphitic corrosion”, a phenomenon in which the metallic matrix is dissolved by the corrosive effect, while a network of graphite flakes remains in its place, maintaining the form of the pipe, but with very low mechanical properties.

**Ductile iron.** In-between steel and gray iron. Both malleable and ductile iron are two kinds of ferrous materials with free nodules of graphite embedded in a matrix of steel. Consequently, corrosion behavior in drinking water systems is in-between, too. Four – five decades has been a usual life in service in urban distribution systems.

**Reinforced concrete.** As a mixed material, properties of the concrete matrix and the reinforcing steel rods are added. According to the operation conditions, the layer of concrete protects the steel against corrosion for a lapse of time. Usually, the advantages are empowered, and the disadvantages are diminished.

**Galvanized steel.** A material where the cathodic protection is given by Zn on steel and a usual low corrosion rate are exploited. Consequently, it was very common in service lines in the middle of the 20th Century, with a life expectation of 2-3 decades.\
​**Stainless steel.** Special pipe material for requirements such as pharmaceutical and food processing water supply. Also, it is often used for valves and fittings.

**Copper.** A noble metal and easy to work as a pipe. Therefore, widely used as a service piping material and for accessories, too.

​

**Corrosion risk**

The experience lived in Flint is a clear warning of the importance of a careful selection of materials, and anti-corrosive measurements, as part of the integral management of the drinking water networks. The risk will be depending on the material. Of course, asbestos is not being used anymore, but the rest of the above mentioned and others are being used. Depending on the operation conditions, products from the interaction between material and water remain on the surface of the pipe or leach downstream, opening the opportunity of affecting the organoleptic properties of the water to be consumed. Also, the remaining corrosion products would be a host of chemical and biological harmful species, potentially dissolved into the water, anytime.

​

Talking about metallic pipes, in the case of ferrous materials, common corrosion products founded on the surfaces are iron oxides and oxyhydroxides as magnetite, goethite, and lepidocrocite. In principle, leaching of iron ions into the downstream could disturb taste, color, and odor. Iron is an essential trace element in living organisms. Toxicity appears only at very high levels, wish are not common in aqueducts, and the taste and appearance of drinking water will usually be extremely affected below the health risky level.\
​

Thinking about corrosion of the Zn layer on galvanized steel or any other situation with this element, it is known that its corrosion products and its ions specifically are relatively harmless, in comparison to several other metal species, and intoxication is a very scarce event. On the opposite side, speciation of metals as Cu, Ni, and Cr, pure and in alloys, is of more serious concern. They are important for life. Also, their anti-microbial properties are an advantage, for instance, preventing the biofilm appearance. Because of the same reason, in high concentrations, they are toxic to human beings. Drinking water is one of the important sources of copper, in addition to food. Of course, drinking water consumption from copper pipe systems can increase exposure. According to the World Health Organization, an upper limit, considering an ingestion of 2-3 L of water a day, must be 2 mg Cu/L. High concentrations must be avoided, not only because such amounts of dissolved Cu can change the organoleptic properties (blueish or blue-green color, and aftertaste), but also because of the health risk. Considering Ni, its health effects include dermatitis, headache, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory illness, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and epigenetic effects. However, prevailing doses of leaching from Ni alloys in normal conditions of operation inside drinking water pipelines are in the same order that amounts founded in a natural environment. Risk rises with the accumulation of the ions due to the operational conditions. A similar situation happens with Cr ions. In general, drinking-water intake is a minor source than food. Nevertheless, there is an increasing concern about situations where the presence of Cr(VI) can be promoted, apparently associated with the dissolution of Cr(0). **[\-Source-](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c03922)**

​

More adherent corrosion products can remain on the pipe surface. Besides, organic and inorganic species into the water can precipitate on the piping walls, independent of the nature of the material, metal, polymer, or ceramic. Deposits or concretions are formed, often tubercles. A typical composition of a surface deposit includes a mixture of corrosion products and others like calcite, aluminosilicates, silica, volatile solids, and organic matter **[\-Source-](https://www.ingeniare.cl/index.php?option=com_ingeniare&view=va&aid=155&vid=65&lang=es)**. Usually, these layers on the inside walls of the pipelines are a proper ecosystem for bacterial growth.

​

Micro bacterial activity on the pipe walls gives rise to other phenomena. The opportunity of simultaneous chemical and biological effects on the metallic subtract of the pipe gives rise to the microbiologically induced corrosion – MIC, an additional mechanism of the attack on the whole infrastructure. As a result, the corrosive attack can be accelerated. Moreover, colonies of microorganisms can be established on the pipe walls, a biofilm, a surface deposit of organic and inorganic materials, including microorganisms, microbial products, and detritus, of slimy appearance. The stability, amount, and influence of this biofilm on the corrosive attack and the water quality depend on the physical, chemical, physicochemical, and hydraulic conditions of the transported water. One of the consequences of biofilm, reported in the “Flint’s crisis” killing the first nine people, is the “Legionnaires’ disease”. This effect is one of the most reported waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA today. The Legionella is a natural bacteria growing as biofilm in water. But at warm temperatures, it has accelerated development. Thus, special niches are systems and equipment in buildings that store hot water for relatively long times, as hotels, hospitals, residences, and others.

**Corrosionists 4.0**

Looking at the current situation of drinking water systems, both in the developed and undeveloped countries, is a paramount challenge for corrosionists and network managers. Current problems concerning the water are huge, and they are related to deleterious effects on the infrastructure, the age of many of the systems, the water treatment conditions, the quality of the liquid to be drunk, and many others. But, as it was said at the beginning, right now, potable water shrinkage is a reality. As a result, in the coming decades, corrosionists must face problems related to the water that we do not have. Probably, one of the challenges to attend will be the management of the integrity of infrastructure supporting water sources exploration on the Moon, Mars, and cosmic bodies.

​\
Something more imminent concerns the Earth’s non-conventional potable sources. One of them, very promising, now in an early development stage, is the desalinization of seawater. The seafood had been an exceptional source of nutrition for humankind, along with history. Other businesses as transportation have been developed thanks to the oceans. Sporadically, aquaculture marine activities are being accomplished. The “Blue Economy'' is starting, and new opportunities are arriving, including new energy sources, new mineral depots, but also the option of freshwater besides. Desalinization is gaining momentum, its cost is high, corrosion prevention is one the main reasons, new materials are needed, cheaper plants, too. This is one of the new challenges, in addition to the traditional ones. Fortunately, there is starting a revolution in materials engineering. We, the professionals in charge of the asset integrity management are responsible for the soon arrival of a revolution in corrosion engineering, too. **Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is good business!**
