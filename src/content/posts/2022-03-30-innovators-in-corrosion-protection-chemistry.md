description: A great tool of our times is Google Patents. It is a patent search
  engine, including the full text of most of the patents ever published

  handled by the worldwide principal patent offices, such as the United States
  Patent and Trademark Office -USPTO, the European Patent Office - EPO, the
  World Intellectual Property Office - WIPO, the China National Intellectual
  Property Administration - CNIPA, the Japan Patent Office - JPO, and the Korean
  Intellectual Property Office - KIPO. Today, we are interested in corrosion
  inhibitors, which global market size in 2021 was USD $ 7.900 million and at an
  estimated CAGR of 4.9%, in 2026 must be around USD $10.100 million. Some of
  the major players in the corrosion inhibitor market are very well globally
  known trademarks such as Baker Hughes, Ecolab (Nalco), BASF, SUEZ, DOW,
  Lanxess, and Henkel. When we put the words “corrosion & inhibitors” as search
  terms in Google Patens, results show that there are “about 135.828” related
  documents (29 of them are applications submitted during 2022). In principle, a
  high proportion of all the documents. It is always interesting to watch
  details of the inventions our colleagues Corrosionists have done, and it is
  easy to suppose that many of the associated documents are related to one of
  the companies mentioned above. Also, in many cases, found documents are not
  explicitly associated with anticorrosive chemicals. Below are curated three
  documents, randomly chosen, one expired patent, one more active, and finally,
  one asked right. Three examples of how possible it is to take part in the
  corrosion inhibitor market by taking advantage of expired patents, being part
  of the business exploitation of patents in force (buying, licensing, and so),
  or, much better, following the example of inventing ourselves.

A great tool of our times is *[Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/)*. It is a patent search engine, including the full text of most of the patents ever published worldwide. Nowadays, its index has more than 120 million patents and requests handled by the worldwide principal patent offices, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office -USPTO, the European Patent Office - EPO, the World Intellectual Property Office - WIPO, the China National Intellectual Property Administration - CNIPA, the Japan Patent Office - JPO, and the Korean Intellectual Property Office - KIPO. Today, we are interested in corrosion inhibitors, which *[global market size](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/Study-Corrosion-Inhibitor-Market-246.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8_qRBhCXARIsAE2AtRZr5L7uVgvY6MLCayHDsfkqNTSaOoUSecVW3iRmXS3Yt4fG4LjQFyUaAsgEEALw_wcB)* in 2021 was USD $ 7.900 million and at an estimated CAGR of 4.9%, in 2026 must be around USD $10.100 million. Some of the major players in the corrosion inhibitor market are very well globally known trademarks such as Baker Hughes, Ecolab (Nalco), BASF, SUEZ, DOW, Lanxess, and Henkel.

**Expired exclusivity**

**Patent granter:** European Patent Office – EPO

**Patent No.:** 811110B1

**Title:** *Oil well treatment*

**Inventor (s):** Hugh Malcolm Bourne and Peter Arne Read

**Applicant (s):** Ricardo AEA Ltd

**Priority date:** 30.05.1995

**Summary:** Porous aluminum or silicon oxide, carbide, or silicate particles in diameters between 0.3 mm to 5.0 mm, are impregnated with a water-soluble chemical corrosion inhibitor that precipitates in the presence of calcium ions. Then, the particles are injected into the well formation or packaged as a filter inside a tube. The inhibitor is gradually leached out into the fluids, inhibiting corrosion and scale formation.

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Patent No.:** 20140011722A1

**Title:** *Use of cellulose nanocrystals as a corrosion inhibitor*

**Inventor (s):** Andrew Garner

**Applicant (s):** X'AAN INNOVATIONS Inc.

**Date of patent:** 09.01.2014

**Summary:** There is presented a way of inhibiting corrosion of steel or aluminum in aqueous saline environments by using an aqueous suspension of a small number of cellulose nanocrystals, 0.1 to 1.0 percent by weight of the carrier, with diameters in the range of 4 to 60 nm and lengths in the range of 150 to 350 nm.) incorporated in a negatively charged ester group by acid hydrolysis (in sulfuric, phosphoric, or polycarboxylic acid).

​

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** China National Intellectual Property Administration - CNIPA

**Application No.:** 114085188A

**Title:** *A kind of imidazoline type corrosion inhibitor and preparation method and application thereof*

**Author(s):** Cui Shizhang, Zhang Xiang, Hong Wangli, Ming Gao, Ruimei Wu, Yanqing Chang,

And Xinming Yin Huiliang.

**Applicant (s):** Deshi Energy Technology Group Co Ltd Shandong Deshi Chemical Co Ltd

**Publication date:** 25.02.2022

**Summary:** The patent application describes the invention of a new imidazoline corrosion inhibitor, including the preparation method and the application procedure in oil extraction, transportation, storage, and processing. An organic acid (capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, erucic acid, or tall oil acid) and an amine (diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentamethylene hexamine, hexamethylene heptamine or hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine. ) in a molar ratio 1: (1-1.2) react during 1-2 h at 90-105 °C and then dehydrated during 4.5-7 h at 140-230 °C, to form an imidazoline intermediate, which reacts with acrylonitrile for 4-6 h at 70-80 °C, resulting in the inhibitor.

**A daring proposal directly linked with the Corrosionists' concerns**

A recent comment by Professor Paul Fennell and Dr. Justin Drivers from the Imperial College London, Professor Steve Davis from the University of California, and Professor Chris Bataille from the Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, published in *[Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00758-4)*, is entitled “Cement and steel — nine steps to net zero.” According to the authors, it is urgent to carry out radical changes about how to obtain and use cement and steel and drastically reduce the almost 5.000 million tons of CO2 yearly emitted by these two industries (13.5% of the total global emissions). A holistic proposal is presented that includes nine action fronts that are described in the article and that refer to:

* Use the latest technologies looking for the improvement of energy use.
* Use less cement and steel by using alternative materials and better designs.
* Reinvent steel production, basically to move to green steel.
* Reinvent cement production, innovating the raw materials and the process in general.
* Swap fuels, looking for available and other options to be explored.
* CCUS offers several pathways toward the safer use of fossil fuels.
* Store CO2 in concrete as a specific option of CCUS.
* Recycle steel beyond the percentage currently recycled, looking for circularity of 100%.
* Subsidize changes because massive changes like the above must be fueled by rules, policies, and incentives.

​**A Pioneer has passed away**

On 22.03.2022 died Aldo Cordeiro Dutra, a Mechanical Engineer that cofounded the Brazilian Corrosion Association – *[ABRACO](https://abraco.org.br/en/)* in 1968. Since then, Aldo became an evangelist of corrosion and anticorrosion subjects in his Country, promoting corrosion awareness among companies and professionals, fostering networking, and encouraging the growth of ABRACO, currently one of the more active corrosion associations worldwide. He was a pioneer in the study and industrial application of cathodic protection. Furthermore, Cordeiro Dutra was a leader in assets management and metrology and offered his services to companies such as INMETRO, the Rio de Janeiro metro company, and PETROBRAS, the Brazilian petroleum company.

​

**Celebrating the Corrosion Awareness Day 2022**

Virtual. One more example of the enthusiasm of the Swedish Corrosionists is the exciting program prepared by Swerim AB together with Jernkontoret, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Jönköping University, Chalmers University of Technology, and others. Speakers will be some of the more Swedish Corrosionists, including Rachel Pettersson, Dan Persson, Nuria Fuertes, and Inger Odnevall. Subjects to be considered are vast, and some are related to corrosion at high temperature, corrosion under mechanical stress, pitting corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, etc.

**Registration deadline:** Friday, April 22 of 2022

**Date:** Monday, April 25 of 2022

**Time:** 13:00 to 16:00 CET (GMT + 2)
