**Keeping a road to the future**

​

Strategic decisions are putting post-Globalization in the picture. The *[New Silk Road](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/what-can-the-new-silk-road-do-for-global-trade)* is an evident effort in such a sense. The increasingly intricate *[submarine communication network](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/)* is another sign of the coming time. But also, a lot of assets supporting energy transportation across the world, such as the Nord Stream, a system of on-and-offshore natural gas pipelines connecting Russia and Central Europe through the Baltic Sea. This is a valuable infrastructure to be *[protected against the aggressiveness](https://news.materials.business/23/03/2021/a-top-notch-burial-for-our-assets)* of several agents, and corrosion engineers are asked for more and new solutions. Advances concerning pipelines protection must be shared, and a specialized journal was launched last year. We are talking about a fascinating fruit of our times: the “Journal of Pipeline Science and Engineering – JPSE.” This is a pioneering peer-review project led by our colleague *[Frank Cheng](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/contacts/frank-cheng)* from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Calgary, Canada. Supporting the Frank’s labor, there is a group of co-editors and editorial board members from many other universities, institutes, and companies from around the globe included very well recognized Corrosionists like Homero Castaneda (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, USA), Richard Barker (School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK), Marcelo Castro (School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Campinas, Brazil), Milos Djukic (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Serbia), Stijn Hertele (Dept. of Electromechanical, Systems and Metal Engineering, Ghent University, Belgium), Saeid Kakooei (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Malaysia), Gholamreza Khalaj (Department of Materials Engineering, Saveh Branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran), Natalya Likhanova (Mexican Petroleum Institute, Mexico), Elsadig Mahdi (Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Qatar University, Qatar), Cem Ornek (Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey), Ilya Ryakhovskikh (Center of Corrosion Monitoring and Corrosion Protection, Gazprom, Russia), and Xiankui Zhu (Savannah River National Laboratory, USA).

​\
JPSE is part of the list of titles published by *[KeAi](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/)*, a partnership between *[Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/)* and *[China Science Publishing & Media Ltd](http://www.cspm.com.cn/home2017/AU2017/)*. Devoted to publishing English language open access journals in several scientific disciplines. PipeChina North Pipeline Company subsidizes JPSE, and authors do not have to pay any publication fee (an enjoyable option when the cost of publishing in open access journals is increasing the barriers to publishing from lower-income regions). Aims of the journal are to provide a medium for sharing scientific and technological knowledge concerning pipeline systems transporting and distributing fuels (e.g., oil, natural gas, heavy oil, diluted bitumen, shale oil, shale gas, oil sands slurry, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, biofuels, etc.). As usual, many of the issues considered are related to the integrity of the systems: design, construction, control, materials, welding, metallurgy, internal and external corrosion, current interferences, coatings, cathodic protection, inhibitors, stress corrosion cracking, fatigue, hydrogen cracking, pipeline integrity management, risk assessment, and management, etc. With this perspective, the inaugural issue of JPSE launched almost one year ago. *[Issue No. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-pipeline-science-and-engineering/vol/1/issue/4)* was the latest in 2021, and a look at its content allows us to understand better the importance of what the journal is bringing to us. We found ten papers, including reviews, case studies, research, and engineering papers dealing with conventional and new transportation issues and the application of converging technologies. From the abstracts of some of them, we can extract:

​

* ​***[“Optimization and intelligent control for operation parameters of multiphase mixture transportation pipeline in oilfield: A case study.”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpse.2021.08.001)*** Production and operation data from an oilfield were collected with a SCADA system. The thermal characteristics of a pipeline network were modeled. Basic operational parameters were predicted. Their optimization using an intelligent control strategy ensures better efficiency and safe and reliable operation of multiphase mixture transportation pipelines in oilfields.

​

* ​***[“A review of multiproduct pipeline scheduling: from bibliometric analysis to research framework and future research directions.”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpse.2021.08.001)*** It is a report about an analysis of publications concerning the multiproduct pipelines scheduling challenge, facing a safe and stable operation in refineries. In the end, the authors achieve a broad overview of the multiproduct pipeline scheduling and directions and suggestions for future research.

​

* ​***[“Current technologies and the applications of data analytics for crude oil leak detection in surface pipelines.”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpse.2021.12.004)*** This increasing critical issue is approached by generating simulation data used to train leak detection and localization with mathematical algorithms and, finally, developing a real-time leak detection and localization model for crude oil surface pipelines.

​\
​***[“Planning of a flexible refined products transportation network in response to emergencies.”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpse.2021.12.004)*** The paper shows how to employ a mixed-integer linear programming model – MILP – as a method of operational planning to increase the flexibility during transportation of refined products. In such a way, the method diminishes the risk of disrupting the supply of products to the end-user when facing unexpected accidents and incidents, such as pipelines failures, natural hazards, and other threats and emergencies.

​

All the papers mentioned above are good examples of the knowledge generated nowadays, and the importance of specialized channels of scientific knowledge spread to improve the protection of materials and assets in the times ahead. Welcome JPSE! and any other new channel of communication and dissemination of the available knowledge or is being generated to protect more and better materials against corrosion towards a more sustainable industry.

​

**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

**Building the routes towards a proper post-globalization**

One of the main challenges facing the arriving times concerns equity around the globe. "Knowledge is power," and sharing it and the capacities about how to use it for wellness is a duty. Scientific and technological knowledge and capabilities, in general, must be considered in a new kind of interaction that is necessary to establish between the metropolis and the periphery, in other words, the developed and the underdeveloped regions. Knowledge and expertise about materials science and engineering is a priority in such collaboration because raw materials have been the axis of the relationship between both parts of the world for many centuries. Besides, historically imbalances in scientific knowledge appropriation have been responsible for the traditional and damaging brain drain from the periphery to the metropolis. A step ahead, looking for reverting the situation and following the expected direction of a more egalitarian and equitable development for all, has been the recently *[proposed](https://www.the-guild.eu/news/2022/the-guild-and-arua-in-full-support-of-the-proposed.html)* an Innovation Agenda between the African Union and the European Union. In this frame, "*[The Guild](https://www.the-guild.eu/news/2022/the-guild-and-arua-in-full-support-of-the-proposed.html)*," a group of 21 European universities, and the African Research Universities Alliance - *[ARUA](https://arua.org.za/)*, a group of 16 of the region's universities, had a summit and concluded with a collaboration plan looking for placing universities at the center of the EU – AU cooperation. Examples of the planned actions are the creation of clusters or centers of excellence, establishing institutes for advanced studies, promoting master’s and doctoral degree programs, etc. We hope that Corrosionists, Material Scientists, and Engineers from the two continents will be able to duly take advantage of this collaboration highway that is opening so that they can contribute effectively to the purpose of having a more egalitarian and equitable way of life for all.

**An ancient material with a great future**

The United Nations General Assembly declared the year 2022 as the "International Year of Glass" to celebrate the heritage and importance of this material in our lives. Excellent news for materials scientists and engineers! Glass could be the "philosopher's stone" of Corrosionists, but many times some of its characteristics are very limiting. It is just a Challenge! Our colleague Nick Birbilis, *[current](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/nick-birbilis)* Interim Dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the Australian National University, a recognized international leader in new materials development, shows us that the future could be different if we build it. This was the subject of his fascinating TED *[talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEdvBoxumw&feature=youtu.be)* in Canberra one year ago. Nick remembered that we know very little about glass, but it has a promising future. For instance, glass hairs less than 20 micrometers are "infinitely" flexible, but also, large dimension glasses show very high toughness. With the options brought by the emerging technologies, including additive manufacturing, possibilities of new processes and uses of glass are infinite. Recycling could be a great answer against severe planet strains such as minerals scarcity, growing demand for energy, and landfills for the used products. Optimistically, he says, "I hope you never look at a glass bottle in the same way."\
