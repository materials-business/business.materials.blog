  ​As a counter measurement against such huge risks, probably the main
  established driver has been the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the
  Agenda for Sustainable Development promulgated by the United Nations six years
  ago. The SDGs reflect a strong recognition among nations, businesses, and
  non-government organizations of the need to improve economic, social, and
  environmental conditions worldwide as the only option of a promising future
  for our descendants. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that
  sustainability is closely tied to the protection of materials. Human
  development is supported by the possibilities of the materials. The planet is
  finite, materials are becoming scarce, their production and usage is the main
  reason for the anthropogenic causes of global warming, prices increase
  permanently, and access to high-quality materials consequently decrease
  increasing inequality. The SDGs are 17 and watching on the list, it is easy to
  conclude that materials handling and protection are directly related to most
  of them. Of course, one of the starting issues is SDG 4 – Quality Education.
  The correct answer to the challenge of proper materials handling starts with

  teaching and training for threats mentioned initially.

# **Educating Corrosionists, a duty more severe than ever!**​ ​

​

**We are not prepared**

​\
​Some people say that the three oldest and most stable institutions worldwide are the army, the church, and the university because their conservatism has been a “protective shell” for centuries. Here we are including education and the educative system. The Panamanian “eduprenour” Ana Lorena Fabrega did a graphical benchmarking remembering us how different today’s industries like telecommunications, computing, music, television, and aerospace are (shifting from the Wright Brothers and Santos-Dumont to the Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos aircrafts), compared to where they were a hundred years ago. Besides**,** the educational system has remained essentially unchanged since the 19th century. Fabregas concludes that our educational system is obsolete, and we as actors of such a system don´t doubt that.

​\
On the other side, concerns about global warming and sustainability of the Earth as our home are growing fast. The Effects are becoming more than evident, and catastrophes are increasing permanently. Also, the sustainability of our current society is putting us at risk, as has been shown with the coronavirus pandemic. Environmental and social sustainability is the biggest threat humanity has ever faced. The challenges are more complex than ever, and the solutions needed could not be more straightforward. Socio-economic concerns have been amplified by accelerated technological disruption through confinement, including automation, virtualization, and digitization of many parts of jobs. A situation where technology is competing not only with our skill but also with our talent. Threats for workers at all levels, including Corrosionists in many field labors (e.g., inspection), but also in the lab (because of robotic R&D), in the plant (because of robots), or in the office (because of artificial intelligence, etc.). That means a severe impact on different sectors, including industry, academy, and services. The labor market is changing profoundly, both in the subjects of interest and how to do the jobs. One of the immediate consequences has been the emergence of the so-called GIG economy or a labor market characterized by free-lance and short-term work contracts. Work is changing too, but education is not yet!

​**A call for action**

​**From call to action. Switching to move**

​One of the spaces for discussing how to improve (or disrupt, if possible) higher education is the International Academy of Technology, Education and Development – **[IATED](https://iated.org/about)**. A conference on education and new learning technologies is organized every year, and the 13th one was held at the beginning of this month (**[EDULEARN21](https://iated.org/edulearn/)**). One of the papers presented in this opportunity was entitled “**[Concept-based corrosion education – can experiential learning and case stories help?](https://library.iated.org/view/BIEZMAMORALEDA2021CON)**”. Authors are four experienced and renowned professors of corrosion from three different countries, and three various programs: Maria Victoria Biezma (**[University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx)**, Spain), Paul Linhardt (**[Technische Universität Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/)**, Austria), and Isha DeCoito & and Yolanda Hedberg (**[The University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/)**, Canada). This range of criteria and experiments led to an analysis of the current situation of corrosion education in Europe and North America, and, finally, proposing some well-proven practices in teaching corrosion science and engineering. Authors started by recognizing a shortage in Corrosionists, associated with a low priority of the topic within the academia, resulting in a low number of professors and a gap of chemistry knowledge with engineering students, and vice-versa, a gap of materials knowledge with the chemistry students. Finally, a big difference between academic vision and actual requirements in practice—a multidisciplinary question that needs to be resolved by universities in the face of the threats and challenges. The procedure of the study aimed to assess the relevance of some of the known active learning methodologies on corrosion learning, seeking to link theoretical concepts and practical applications. Finally, four teaching strategies have been established as recommendations that can follow, seeking to improve corrosion education’s impact and reduce the gap between the university and the world outside. In principle, the strategies are both curricular and extracurricular, and in their background, there is a much better collaboration into the frame of the Triple Helix Academia-Industry-Government. In addition to all the theoretical fundamentals required, education and training must be accomplished with self-learning supported by a strong linkage with practice by didactic practices as storytelling of actual cases, outdoor sightseeing tours, field trips to industrial sites, and industrial guest lectures. We can say that this is one of the ways that we can promote from academia, the industry, and the government. Also, we can say that there are many others to be developed. However, time is of the essence, and we must hurry to prepare the Corrosionists the world needs: More open-minded professionals, with a deeper specialization, but simultaneously strongly transversal, innovative, entrepreneurial, resilient, able to face the world. Significant threats, grand challenges, but great Corrosionists ready to answer expectedly. This is an issue of the Triple Helix, but we, the Corrosionist, have the ethical duty of promoting the change.

**Non-intrusive corrosion monitoring**

**​**

The new Plantweb Insight Non-Intrusive Corrosion application for non-intrusive corrosion monitoring complements the existing, when instrumented with in-line probes, changes in corrosion risk can be detected within minutes, allowing sites to take corrective action before damage occurs, Plantweb Insight Corrosion applications allow users to access and analyze data from pipe thickness monitoring sensors and probes online at their desk and obtain advanced real-time analysis to assess risk and the impact of corrosion or erosion on the asset or plant.

**CEA develops a process to improve the recycling of photovoltaic panels**

**​**

The central technology of the new recycling process for photovoltaic panels, the Grenoble laboratory dedicated to the energy transition of the Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission, is interested. To bring it to industrialization, the researchers will work within the framework of the European photorama project, the agreement of which was signed in June 2021. It will associate the CEA Liten with several industrialists, including the Italian Enel Green Power and the Spanish automation cooperative Mondragon Assembly.

**Electrical transmission asset inspection**

**​**

A safe and effective flight is founded on drone hardware, but transmission towers present a challenging environment for any aircraft; they may be in windy or wet areas, and their power lines are difficult to maneuver around. In this case, drone operators fly hardware that’s purpose-built for such a challenging environment. The hardware:

● Is lightweight but rugged, allowing for agile operations

● Includes guards on its rotor blades to mitigate damage or injury that could occur on contact

● Has multiple rotors for redundancy

● Is deployed with a high-resolution camera, enabling the operator to balance data fidelity with safe handling
