The above is an attractive series of activities showing the interest in the protection of materials, but even very short taking into account the importance of the subject, considering the incidence of materials stability in the coming times. We, the evangelists of corrosion and protection, must disseminate awareness of corrosion throughout society; the community of corrosionists must be more vital and more active; industry must be more responsible in the conservation of materials, and managers must have the expertise to deal with these topics. The education systems must assume their rightful role. Teachers must be more proactive. Students must be more modern than modernists (more attracted by transcendental issues than by superfluous ones). Current and new professional organizations must be more vigorous and active. More robust and new, and more effective information channels are needed, too. Governments need to catalyze such actions through policies, funds, and tools within education, industry, and innovation systems. This is the only way to contribute to global sustainability targets from the perspective of engineering materials.

**Celebrating with work**

As a contribution to the World Corrosion Awareness Day celebration, below is a review of an invaluable **[speech](https://mediasite.osu.edu/Mediasite/Play/ad791c21d0384e0ca5798085b422ecdd1d)** recently given by Prof. Gerald S. Frankel, Director of the Fontana Corrosion Center at the Ohio State University, U.S.A. Jerry’s primary research interests are in the passivation and localized corrosion of metals and alloys, corrosion inhibition, protective coatings, and atmospheric corrosion. He has received several awards because of his significant contribution to the understanding of corrosion phenomena. De facto, Professor Frankel gave a “Master Class” about “A framework for pitting based on pit growth stability” and could help all the colleagues who did not have the opportunity to witness it and learn some of the relevant details.

**There is no little enemy**

Pitting is a big, tiny problem. Typically, a small area has deteriorated, but the impact is disproportionately large. All people suffer its effects: on the teeth, implants, cooking pots, cars, etc., but also socially and industrially in public and private infrastructure, buildings, factories, equipment, parts, etc. We are talking about a situation where size doesn’t matter, but the consequences could colossally impact. It is a problem with a small, complex, difficult to follow, study, and understanding.

**A scientific approach**

In principle, pitting corrosion is a surface phenomenon resulting from heterogeneity existing or created as any corrosion process. A microstructural heterogeneity like inclusions or any other defect. Or a heterogeneity in the surface film, like a porous, a crack, or any weaker point, created by its configuration or any external effect, chemical, mechanical, etc. A typical attack mechanism on stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and other passivating metals. Until five-six decades before, technical limitations, the study of pitting corrosion was very limited because instrumental techniques were almost reduced to metallographic microscopy. Corrosionists used empirical procedures to assess the extension of the pitting attack, such as point count by area and depth measurement by a calibrated needle. The 1970s started a significant development supported by the electron microscope’s possibilities and other microscopical and spectroscopic new techniques. Scientific contributions like the mentioned by Frankel included a lot of research led by Professors as Jose R. Galvele (†2011), Roger C. Newman (University of Toronto), G. T. Burstein (University of Cambridge). Philippe Marcus (Paris Sciences & Lettres University). Recent developments are encompassed with instrumentation advances. Supported on these possibilities, a lot of research led by Frankel and others currently allows us to have a much better idea about pitting corrosion**.** In essence, pitting corrosion is a local breakdown of the passive film, resulting in the substrate's rapid local dissolution. Cathodic reactions consume oxygen outside the pit, accelerated anodic dissolution occurs inside the pit, promoted by the enrichment in aggressive ions like chlorides and a pH decrease, and converting the process as autocatalytic.

**The proposed model**

Frankel’s proposal begins by considering pitting potential, repassivation potential, and critical pitting temperature as the pitting resistance parameters. In addition, factors affecting the stability and growth rate of pits have been examined. Such factors are the environment (basically the salt film inside the pit), the temperature, and the alloy composition. The result is a unified framework for pitting corrosion growing, simultaneously including all the parameters mentioned earlier. According to the author, a key new concept is the maximum pit dissolution current density. With this and the other parameters, it is possible to estimate the pit growth***,*** stability, charge transfer control, and salt film formation (diffusion control). In the end, an integrated tool for determining the critical pitting temperature, the pitting potential, the repassivation potential, and the influence of alloying elements. A powerful instrument for prediction of performance and design of corrosion-resistant alloys.

**Ups and downs in the stainless steel tanks market**

**[Columbus Stainless](https://www.columbus.co.za/)**, a company of the Acerinox Group, is one of the leading SS international suppliers and the only SS mill in the continent, based in South Africa. According to its Market Development Manager, in an interview recently **[published](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/increase-in-tanks-demand-presents-challenges-2021-04-09)**, over the past 12 months, there has been a global increase in SS tank production, particularly for the food and beverage sectors. Reasons include the growing trends in such industries, the SS better behavior facing increasing hygienic requirements, and its lower life-cycle costing. Besides, other sectors like the liquor industry have suffered the impact of the lockdown regulations, and some of its expansion plans have been canceled. Also, several small liquor companies have gone out of business.

**Corrosion is not in quarantine, but it is being surveilled**

This is the case in **[SP Energy Networks](https://www.spenergynetworks.co.uk/)**, a distribution and transmission network operator in charge of the energy supply for 3.5 million customers in Central Scotland, North Wales, and North England. The Company signed an agreement with **[Cyberhawk](https://thecyberhawk.com/)**, a company devoted to the asset inspection in the energy sector by drones information capture, visualization software, and data processing by cloud computing. In a **[video](https://youtu.be/JAydwuUjDv4)**, both companies' representatives explain how they are proceeding with critical inspection services throughout the coronavirus pandemic. This new procedure substituted another one with helicopters, which gives accurate information from all the critical points, showing defects, even at a very early stage. After the information processing, software achieves a report by each tower, in different presentation forms, for technical and financial decisions, in a shorter time, and lower impact on landowners, intersecting ways traffic, and environmentally.

**Corrosion control by inhibitors**

**[Anodamine](https://www.anodamine.com/)** is a water treatment company serving industries like power generation, petroleum/petrochemical, pulp and paper, and sugar. Recently, the Company published a free access **[white paper](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60070f4bab8224386561efc6/t/605a55f7a6ebba3a92b33acc/1616532991773/Two_Phase_FAC_White_Paper.pdf)** about “The Control of Two-Phase Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC).” In this document, the authors present an example of mitigation of corrosion assisted by the circulation of a two-phase fluid in a steam-water system of a combined cycle power plant. The offered control is based on an own product. Results were validated by doing several kinds of analysis. In conclusion, corrosion was drastically reduced, along with lower maintenance costs, shorter start-ups, and removal of nitrogen blanketing and dehumidified air.
