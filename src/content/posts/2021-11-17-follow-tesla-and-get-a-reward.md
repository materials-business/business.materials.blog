description: Immediately following his arrival in the United States, Tesla filed
  its first patent application in respect of an electric arc lamp. The last one,
  in 1928, was about an apparatus for aerial transportation. In total, there are
  registered in the US Patents and Trademarks Office 112 patents. Many of them
  also awarded as derivated patents in other countries like France, the UK, and
  Germany. Many of his inventions were protected by patents, but others not
  (such as the application of high frequency current for medical purposes). The
  inventions focus mainly on telecommunications, electrical and mechanical
  engineering, clinical technology, and aviation. Tesla contributed with other
  innovators like Wilhelm Röntgen for the X-ray discovery. Some of the Tesla’s
  inventions included the telephone repeater, the rotating magnetic field
  principle, the wireless communication, the radio, the fluorescent lights, and
  many others. Nowadays, some of his inventions are inspiring engineers and
  innovators looking for further solutions. This is the case of the wireless
  transmission of electrical power, described in a patent application presented
  1897 and awarded on March 20th of 1900, the high frequency medical treatment
  mentioned before, and the “helicopter-airplane” patent granted in 1928, that
  could take off and land vertically in a way extremely interesting for aviation
  in the coming years. An issue related to his constant concern about the need
  for everyone to have electricity anywhere. One of his greatest contributions
  about the energy that we need today, is synthesized in the construction and
  operation of the world’s first large scale alternating current hydroelectric
  plant, in 1896, on the Niagara River, to transmit electricity to the Buffalo
  city, 14 km away. The project was developed on the basis of 12 patents, nine
  of which relate to Tesla's inventions such as the polyphase alternating
  current system, induction motor, coil transformer, three phase variable
  reluctance motor, armature for electric machines, electric generator, and the
  others about alternating-current power transmission.

**Nikola**

​\
Nikola Tesla was another of the inventors and entrepreneurs, like Noble, Edison, Marconi, etc., responsible for fueling the Second Industrial Revolution during the change of centuries between the 19th and 20th. Tesla born in 1856 in the today Croatian village of Smiljan. He studied engineering at the Joanneum Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, and then natural sciences at the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. As engineer worked for telecommunications companies, then migrated to the United States in 1884 where he expanded most of his innovation activity, until 1943, when he passed away in New York in 1943.

Immediately following his arrival in the United States, Tesla filed its first patent application in respect of an electric arc lamp. The last one, in 1928, was about an apparatus for aerial transportation. In total, there are registered in the US Patents and Trademarks Office ***[112](https://nikolateslamuseum.org/en/patents/)*** patents. Many of them also awarded as derivated patents in other countries like France, the UK, and Germany. Many of his inventions were protected by patents, but others not (such as the application of high frequency current for medical purposes). The inventions focus mainly on telecommunications, electrical and mechanical engineering, clinical technology, and aviation. Tesla contributed with other innovators like Wilhelm Röntgen for the X-ray discovery. Some of the Tesla’s inventions ***[included](https://teslasciencefoundation.org/patents/)*** the telephone repeater, the rotating magnetic field principle, the wireless communication, the radio, the fluorescent lights, and many others. Nowadays, some of his inventions are inspiring engineers and innovators looking for further solutions. This is the case of the ***[wireless transmission of electrical powe](https://emrod.energy/)*r**, described in a patent application presented 1897 and awarded on March 20th of 1900, the ***[high frequency medical treatment](http://img-medicalgroup.com/en/downloads/95_archiv6653_186762.pdf)*** mentioned before, and the “helicopter-airplane” patent granted in 1928, that could take off and land vertically in a way extremely interesting for ***[aviation in the coming years](https://en.skydrive2020.com/)***. An issue related to his constant concern about the need for everyone to have electricity anywhere.

Scientific societies, museums and others are named after Tesla as a tribute. Also, in 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), in 1960, established the Tesla unit of field intensity for magnetic fields (T), defined as the field intensity generating one newton of force per ampere of current per meter of conductor: T = N.A⁻¹.m⁻¹. But probably, the greater tribute has been the foundation of Tesla Motors Inc. in 2003 by engineers and entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.

​\
​\
​

**The Company**

​\
​We are talking about currently named Tesla Inc., formerly Tesla Motors Inc., which has been led by Elon Musk since 2004 when he took part in a round of venture capital financing and invested USD $6.5 million or 87% of the expected funding. Tesla Inc. has become one of the four US companies appraised over USD $1.000.000.000 joint together Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Currently, Musk is presented as the richest person worldwide. These are figures about a company that, in agreement with the founders' spirit, sells conventional body cars just equipped with a battery and the software for empowering the wheels. A product that is leading the Fourth Industrial Revolution or the fusion between the physical and virtual worlds. Intangible assets instead of tangible ones. As we mentioned ***[before](https://news.materials.business/12/01/2021/very-painful-to-see-my-car-is-corroded)***, cars are changing from more than 20.000 parts in conventional fuel automobiles towards some hundreds in e-cars. A small number of parts are a great business. However, when we look at USPTO records, we see that 814 patents and applications were granted or filed on behalf of Tesla Inc. as the owner. A car with more incorporated patents than parts. According to the trends, Tesla is selling more and more patented knowledge incorporated in fewer and fewer parts. In some way, the cost of the Company is the cost of its patents. A great reward for following Nikola Tesla!

​\
​

Such an amount of Tesla’s patents or applications includes many issues, some of them indirectly ***[related](https://news.materials.business/05/10/2021/corrosion-resistant-light-alloys-smart-surface-cleaning-and-more-sustainable-cars)*** to corrosion and anticorrosion subjects. But many are directly related to engineering materials, and some are concerned directly with corrosion prevention. As always, behind successful brands, people are working hard. Here, it is possible to mention inventors and two of the major worldwide figures in nanotechnology directly related to Tesla NanoCoatings, Jorma Antero Virtanen, Chief Scientist, and Todd Hawkins, CEO, inventors of almost 50 patents or applications in the list mentioned earlier. The following is one of the inventions consolidating the current reign of the Company:

​

**An invention granted (in force)**

**​**

**Patent granter:** US Patent & Trademark Office - USPTO

**Patent No.:** 10,074,454

**Title:** *Method for corrosion prevention*

**Inventor (s):** Jorma Antero Virtanen and Todd Hawkins

**Applicant (s):** Tesla Nanocoatings, Inc.

**Date of patent:** 11.09.2018

**Expiration:** 31.08.2032 (Anticipated)

**Summary:** A complex, multi constituent, a cathodic protective coating was invented with properties depending on the nano-scale behavior of its constituents. The patent includes 19 claims concerning the coating and the application method. The coating formulation invented includes metal nanoparticles nobler than the passivated steel substrate, comprising at least one of Ni, Co, or Mo; a mixture of graphite nanotubes, graphene, and graphite acting as an electric bridge in between the noble metal particles; an antioxidant such as tannic acid; aluminum i-propoxide, trimethyl borate, or lead oxide; sacrificial metal nanoparticles less noble than the substrate (Zn, Al or Mg); silica, alumina, titanium oxide, copper oxide, or tin oxide nanoparticles; and cellulose. In the end, a conventional polymeric matrix, v.gr. epoxy, as the body of the protective powder coating.

​

For sure, Tesla following Tesla is bringing great rewards. Without a doubt, the Corrosionists following Tesla will also get them!



​**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**
