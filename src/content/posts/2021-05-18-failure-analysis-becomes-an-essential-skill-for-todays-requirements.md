# **FAILURE ANALYSIS BECOMES AN ESSENTIAL SKILL FOR TODAY'S REQUIREMENTS**

**Bad news, valuable engineering answers**

There are times when the news is not good. Catastrophic events due to the failure of materials, products, components, and structures happen. Some months ago, Materials. Business **[reported](https://news.materials.business/08/12/2020/lets-revolutionize-steelmaking-again)** the collapse of the Arecibo Observatory Telescope in Puerto Rico, a significant loss to the world of science. An accident related to the broken of the cables supporting the dome. At the beginning of the current month, a **[collapse of the elevated part of the subway train in Mexico City](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/04/americas/mexico-subway-collapse-intl-hnk/index.html)** killed over 25 and hurt almost 80 people. In both cases, forensic engineering investigations must be done, looking to identify the failure reasons. Examples show that adverse effects range widely. However, behind each accident, a material failure took place. Reasons for the failure are essential for many purposes. Most of the time, the primary goal is to identify the culprit and all the consequences after that. But from the point of view of materials engineers, the fundamental question is why the material fails. In other words, engineers try to find the so-called “root cause” of the accident. Some common material failure modes are stress fracture (ductile or brittle), fatigue, corrosion, wear, and creep. Therefore, fault analysis **[involves](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-007-0013-6)** steps like evaluating mechanical properties, macroscopic and microscopic examination, a review of design features, and analysis of finite elements.\
​

**New scenery for failure analysis specialists**

The above must be the traditional attitude facing the failure of materials. Nonetheless, nowadays, it is necessary to think about the challenges arriving with sustainability concerns. A challenge like the growing rarity of materials leads to the need to introduce engineering materials into circularity. Failure Analysis becomes a prime source of feedback contributing to circularity purposes like materials design and selection; product manufacturing; use, monitoring, and maintenance; looking in the end, for the most extended product end of life. These are challenging times for all of us. We have needed to rethink the traditional way of doing things and generate new advanced strategies; it is inevitable to face the unique challenges that the pandemic imposes on us. New ways of doing things have been learned to optimize resources and the different alternatives to achieve them. In all areas of knowledge, adapting to new demands and obtaining better benefits with fewer resources is imperative.​

Industrial processes do not are alien to this circumstance. In this sense, reliability, defined as the probability that equipment operates for a certain time without presenting failures, leads us to implement methodologies that allow us to identify their presence but, above all, to avoid its recurrence.​

Beyond the concept of detection and identification of failures, the Failure Analysis appears like a fundamental tool to find the root cause of its occurrence and thus minimize or eliminate its appearance. But this task requires the agreement of a group of professionals who contribute to identifying its causes. But mainly, and behold the added value, propose recommendations for corrective action to prevent this from happening. This methodology, together with the new communication strategies as a valuable tool for teamwork, is the common thread that leads us to optimize resources to better perform the processes with reliable teams.​

Therefore, the new strategies that we had to be put in place to deal with non-standard situations this has allowed us begun to collect our cognitive skills and enhance skills that have climbed at all levels of our daily lives. We need to: work as a team, optimize resources and face the new challenges that the lessons learned from the pandemic have left for everyone.

# Materials Biz News

**The confluence of emerging technologies for industry rocketing**

**​[Arvizio](https://www.arvizio.io/)** offers a mixture of tools, including unmanned aerial vehicles photogrammetry, 3D solutions, augmented reality, and the internet of things. In such a way, industry customers may develop engineering projects visualizing and interacting with scalable physical or virtual models directly. Required hardware includes smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses, not more.



**​Identifying and monitoring the risk of polluted areas**

We know that materials and corrosion engineering are directly associated with the risk of contamination by scrap, leakages, etc. Prevention, monitoring, and cleaning become usual practices. Consequently, **[Bluesky](https://www.bluesky-world.com/)**, a global company with offices in Ireland, UK, the USA, and India, offers GIS data and aerial survey services. Applications include, **[for instance](https://www.bluesky-world.com/post/bluesky-aerial-maps-light-the-way-for-contaminated-site-investigation-and-clean-up)**, the photogrammetric survey of the old Anchor Color and Gum Works site in Dighton, Massachusetts, USA, getting information for plan remediation of the former manufacturing facility before redevelopment.



**​Promising alloys for harsh marine environments**

**​[According to researchers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmst.2021.01.088)** from the Laboratory of Marine Materials and Related Technologies, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, China, MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co, NiCo) can be modified to avoid the discontinuities in the oxide layer when exposed to temperatures above 500 °C in the presence of salty water. Using thermodynamic data processing, they evaluated ternary and quaternary systems, including Al, Ni, Si, Y, and rare earth elements. In the end, the researchers concluded that NiSiAlY alloys with 1-5% Si, 11-20% Al, and 1% Y, can show a good combination of high strength, good high-temperature anti-oxidation, and excellent corrosion resistance.

**A common corrosion problem hitting the cultural heritage**

The Nakagin Capsule Tower is an iconic residential and office building located in Shimbashi, Tokyo, Japan. The tower represents the famous post-World War II Japanese architectonic style. Since its completion in 1972, this structure has fascinated architects, designers, and architectural lovers. After the announcement of the demolition plans for the tower, it was not long before the architectural community shared their thoughts and what would be needed to preserve the iconic building. Since rust occupies a larger volume than steel, it exerts internal pressure, which causes the surrounding concrete to crack and become damaged. These cracks make their way to the surface of the concrete which causes even more CO₂ and Cl⁻ to penetrate the concrete and speed up the process. A typical problem of corrosion in reinforced concrete affects cultural heritage, again.
