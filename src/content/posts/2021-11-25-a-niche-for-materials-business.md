description: Simple but complex, PT may be divided also by blocks, according to
  the energy of the higher-level energy occupied. One of these is the f block,
  which includes two sub rows called lanthanoids and actinoids. The lanthanoid
  series are the rare-earth metals, rare-earth oxides, or rare-earth elements –
  REEs, including 15 elements, plus yttrium and scandium because of their
  similar properties. REEs are classified as light (lanthanum, cerium,
  praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium and
  scandium) and heavy REEs (terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium,
  ytterbium, lutetium and yttrium). Sometimes the chemical elements of the
  actinoid series are also considered to be REEs. In this group, only actinium,
  thorium, protactinium, and uranium occur in nature. The transuranium elements
  are obtained by bombarding the naturally occurring actinoids. REEs is an
  understandable name, especially when they were discovered, but one that
  perhaps weighs them down and helps keep them a bit out of the more
  conventional chemical processes, unfamiliar, and forgotten for being "rare."
  REEs are similar in appearance, most of the time mineralogical associated in
  the same ore deposits and, consequently, difficult to separate. REEs show very
  similar chemical properties and differences, mainly in electronic and magnetic
  properties. Gadolinite was the first mineral containing REEs discovered in
  1787, which is a nesosilicate with the chemical formula (Ce,La,Nd,Y)₂ FeBe₂
  Si₂O₁₀. Until the 1990s, the USA was the largest producer of REEs in the
  world. Then, China became the first one producing about 60 percent of the
  worldwide REEs in 2020, followed by the USA and Myanmar, sharing another 30
  percent. Rare-earth metal production worldwide had risen from 190.000 tons in
  2018 to 220.000 tons in 2019 and 240.000 tons in 2020. The main application of
  REEs is in permanent magnets for traction motors for electric vehicles, cell
  phones, TVs, computers, hard disk drives, microphones, speakers, wind turbine
  generators, jet aircraft, LED lights, lasers, LCD and plasma screens, etc. In
  addition, the catalyst (e.g., petroleum refining and automobile fumes
  conversion) and ceramic sectors (e.g., superconductors and glass and enamels
  colorants) are demanding REEs. Ultimately, metallurgy is being applied to
  obtaining special alloys such as new stainless steel, hydrophobic coatings,
  and battery and fuel cell alloys. In other words, REEs are the elements of the
  post-globalization time, the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution under
  sustainability threats, and the energy transition goal. But a considerable
  exploration looking for the undiscovered deposits, considering conventional
  and new sources as the seabed sediments, much better ore processing, and
  proper recycling and recovery, underlining urban mining, are required because
  we are talking about almost a fifth part of the chemical elements found in
  nature!

# **Materials.Business Weekly ⚙️**

*November 23, 2021*

**Quote of the week:**  “Ask of the steel, each strut, and wire, … What gave it force and power.” **Joseph B. Strauss, U.S.A. structural engineer, chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge (1870 – 1938).**

# **A niche for materials business**



**Taking advantage of Mendeleev’s legacy**

​

All of us know that chemical reactions are omnipresent in corrosion phenomena. One way or another, corrosionists are chemists. Chemistry deals with chemical elements. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry – IUPAC -, a ***[chemical element](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/C01022)*** is “a species of atoms; all atoms with the same number of protons in the atomic nucleus.” In principle, few elements, a little over one hundred, but only the first 94 of which occur in nature, constitute the complexity of our current universe. A series of elements systematized according to some of their properties by Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev(1834–1907), the Russian chemist who found that chemical elements could be arranged such that basic properties repeat periodically, depending on the atomic number. Considering this periodicity, Mendeleev invented the Periodic Table - PT, a graphic description of the periodicity. It's more than just a map of chemical elements. In fact, the PT was Mendeleev’s tool for clarifying properties of some of the elements and predicting properties, behaviors, and even elements non-discovered yet. The PT currently ***[includes](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pac-2018-0918/html)*** eighteen columns, families, or groups with similar electronic configuration and valence, ranging from alkaline metals to noble gases. Seven horizontal rows or periods put together the elements according to their trend on atomic radii, ionization energy, electronic affinity, and electronegativity. In addition, some subgroups or categories according to their physicochemical properties can be recognized across the table, such as metals (transition metals, refractory metals, and noble ones), metalloids, and non-metals. From the beginning, the simple map that apparently is PT offers many of the answers that we are looking for current problems and will surely provide the information necessary to solve those we do not yet have. Two years ago, the United Nations did a tribute to the Ps, celebrating the 150 years of the first Mendeleev table, declaring 2019 as “The International Year of the Periodic Table”. These are some of the ***[words](https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/welcome-to-the-international-year-of-the-periodic-table/3009851.article)*** by Qi-Feng Zhou, IUPAC President welcoming such celebration: “There is no scientific symbol more ubiquitous than the periodic table. It is a map of our knowledge, particularly in chemistry, and a symbolic representation of the process of scientific research. It is also a reference tool that is much needed in scientific communication. The history of the periodic table and IUPAC demonstrates the gradual perfection of scientific research and the continuous effort for better communication to facilitate it.”

​**A “forgotten” group of elements**

​

Simple but complex, PT may be divided also by blocks, according to the energy of the higher-level energy occupied. One of these is the f block, which includes two sub rows called lanthanoids and actinoids. The lanthanoid series are the rare-earth metals, rare-earth oxides, or rare-earth elements – REEs, including 15 elements, plus yttrium and scandium because of their similar properties. REEs are ***[classified](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts/20522#L1)*** as light (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium and scandium) and heavy REEs (terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium and yttrium). Sometimes the chemical elements of the actinoid series are also considered to be REEs. In this group, only actinium, thorium, protactinium, and uranium occur in nature.

Until the 1990s, the USA was the largest producer of REEs in the world. Then, China became the ***[first](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270277/mining-of-rare-earths-by-country/)*** one producing about 60 percent of the worldwide REEs in 2020, followed by the USA and Myanmar, sharing another 30 percent. Rare-earth metal production worldwide had ***[risen](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/critical-metals-investing/rare-earth-investing/rare-earths-market-update/)*** from 190.000 tons in 2018 to 220.000 tons in 2019 and 240.000 tons in 2020. The main application of REEs is in permanent magnets for traction motors for electric vehicles, cell phones, TVs, computers, hard disk drives, microphones, speakers, wind turbine generators, jet aircraft, LED lights, lasers, LCD and plasma screens, etc. In addition, the catalyst (e.g., petroleum refining and automobile fumes conversion) and ceramic sectors (e.g., superconductors and glass and enamels colorants) are demanding REEs.

​**An excellent opportunity for Corrosionists**

​\
​We can affirm that until now, from the science and engineering of corrosion and protection, only a timid approach to the use of the unexplored properties of REE has been observed. However, it is worth examining the scientific literature for the results of the approaches in the topic. One of the research lines is concerned with anticorrosive coatings for ***[Mg alloys](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.09.192)*** and ***[galvanized coatings on steel](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0300-9440(01)00250-8)***. Also, the effect of the REEs on the behavior of ***[conversion coatings](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jre.2018.05.003)*, *[cladding](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11666-021-01193-z)***, and other ***[thermal barriers](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12598-019-01307-1)*** has been studied. Other research deals with their effect as ***[corrosion inhibitors](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2008.06.026)***. Furthermore, the study as alloying elements has been reported, including ***[steels](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jre.2020.06.015)***, ***[light alloys](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jre.2020.07.010)***, ***[refractory alloys](https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings11091144)***, ***[biomedical alloys](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12598-020-01668-y)***.

​\
​

This is simply the starting point for the wide range of available opportunities to materials scientists and engineers, particularly Corrosionists. PT is a great tool, and today with the technologies available, it is possible to dive deeper into an ocean of up to now secrets. We can use information technologies such as neural networks, big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain. In addition, new microscopic and spectroscopic research tools and the use of recently discovered concepts such as complex composition alloys, high entropy alloys, and multi-principal element alloys open up a world of new material properties, including high corrosion resistance. In addition, the development of processing methods and practices such as additive manufacturing adds other possibilities to the new era of anti-corrosion measures and asset protection. Corrosives are responsible for developing new alloys, coatings, paints, and inhibitors, thus taking advantage of the REE niche.

**​[A protective coating for steel](https://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=57263)**​

​

The compound, developed by Rice University materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan, has proven to be more dielectric than most flexible materials and more flexible than most dielectrics, making it a good candidate for components in electronics such as flexible mobile phones. For testing against sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are known to accelerate corrosion up to 90 times faster than abiotic invaders, coated and uncoated samples were exposed to plankton and biofilms for 30 days.

​

Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) is a long-standing problem many industries face, threatening the integrity of insulated piping and equipment. It has been estimated that 40-60% of piping maintenance or 10% of the total maintenance budget can be attributed to CUI. It is recognized that the main challenges imposed by the CUI phenomenon are the difficulty in inspection and early detection. It is also acknowledged that the cost of corrosion can be further reduced by implementing the current knowledge and existing prevention strategies. TWI invites companies to joint to an Industry Project entitled “Integrity management of corrosion under insolation”. Its general objective is to “develop and improved risk based methodology for applying RBI to CUI supported by recent new insights, field data collection (historical and new projects) and focused laboratory testing of coating performance.”

​

This challenge seeks solutions and tools that can constitute a robust blue carbon credit supply. The main goal of this challenge is to find and support high-quality blue carbon projects that advance the conservation and restoration of coastal and aquatic ecosystems. Results that must impact the carbon market and achieve solutions that help build trust and transparency in such projects—a true challenge for Corrosionists in front of the Circular Economy possibilities.
