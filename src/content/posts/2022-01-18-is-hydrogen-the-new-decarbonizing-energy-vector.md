Hydrogen is the most abundant element in nature, but most of it exists bonded to other elements, forming water and other compounds, which make hydrogen unavailable on its own. However, hydrogen has been there from the beginning of the universe, when the young space was dark, and the first stars appeared thanks to the primordial hydrogen gas becoming so dense that the first nuclear fusion reactions took place. Therefore, we can conclude that hydrogen has been helping the universe, and finally, the humankind to exist.

But how is this related to energy? Hydrogen has been involved in high-demanding energy processes, such as the beginning of the universe because it has the most energy per weight among all the elements in nature. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why hydrogen will be useful in energy applications.

And how come we haven't heard of hydrogen until now? Because separating hydrogen from the other elements is costly and energy demanding. But now, we have been developing the required technology to separate and bond hydrogen to other fundamental element, the oxygen, to store and produce clean energy. We are using the basic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, producing water to decarbonize the energy system due to its highly exothermic nature.

Hence, the next question is: why do we need to decarbonize the energy system? Because most of our energy system is based on hydrocarbon, non-renewable fuels, responsible for the sadly famous global warming. This is caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, threatening our existence in the planet and destroying the ecosystems of millions of other species.

Consequently, hydrogen, which has a lot of energy and can store this energy without releasing greenhouse gases, is now presented as a decarbonizing energy vector. This is happening when renewable energy, such as solar, wind and hydropower, is used to produce hydrogen from water in pieces of equipment named electrolyzes. Then, hydrogen can be stored and transported when the energy is further needed. At that moment, energy can be extracted from hydrogen, reversing the initial reaction, obtaining energy in fuel cells. In these devices, hydrogen and oxygen react to produce water, electricity, and heat. This carbon-free cycle, in which the hydrogen involved is called green-hydrogen, can be as efficient and reliable as electrolyzes and fuel cells are. This technology rapidly grows, allowing hydrogen to become a main actor in the worldwide energy system.

Therefore, the implementation of the H2 economy is an international commitment that dates back several decades. The most advanced countries in this career, such as Germany, Australia, and Chile, have implemented, among others, the following strategies to make this decarbonization option viable: (i) Policies for the gradual elimination of dependence on coal. (ii) Deployment of renewable energy production. (iii) Agendas for international cooperation in the renewable energy market. (iv) Development of adequate infrastructure for the energy transition. (v) Incentives for research and development of these new technologies on an industrial scale. (vi) Tax exemption. (vii) Promotion of communication strategies between the sectors involved. And (viii) generation of policies associated with the implementation of alternative fuels. These national hydrogen strategies have allowed regions such as Europe anticipated to have a significant market share in the global market. The growth of the region is being primarily driven by the presence of green hydrogen projects. Asia-Pacific is estimated to have considerable growth in the global market during the forecast period. The presence of cohesive government initiatives is likely to drive the growth of the regional market.

Another important factor to this development is that carbon-free renewable energies such as solar and wind are becoming cheaper and spreading around the world. However, they are intermittent and depend on natural elements such as sunlight and wind. That is why green hydrogen can overcome this intermittency, becoming a reliable energy vector. But, as with any new technology, this option has challenges to overcome, many of them related to material science.

Materials are involved in the electrolyzes and fuel cells, where hydrogen is obtained and used to produce energy, respectively. These electrolytic devices are comparable because the same reaction is occurring but in the reverse direction. They have anodes, cathodes, and membranes covered with precious and non-precious metals and polymeric materials that need to improve their durability and efficiency to reduce the technology cost. Also, materials are involved in hydrogen transport, an important factor of the hydrogen value chain. Hydrogen is small and highly reactive, so its transport is a challenge regarding the durability of pipes, the process safety, and, of course, the cost. Furthermore, hydrogen transport in solids is an incipient research line that can give interesting results in the middle term to overwhelm the challenges when transporting hydrogen.

The main applications envisioned to green hydrogen use are related to transport, which is a sector highly demanding in carbon-based fuels and therefore responsible for a large amount of greenhouse emissions worldwide. It is expected that hydrogen can be the new fuel to power small and large passenger vehicles, cargo vehicles, trains, airplanes, and ships. Also, hydrogen will be used to power and heat houses and buildings and heat many industrial processes.

Then, we have learned that green hydrogen is a high-energy density, carbon-free vector which can be produced from water powered by cheap renewable energy. The massification of this interesting application will be possible thanks to the soon-expected improvement of the electrolytic technology associated with the water reaction and the overcoming of the restrictions associated with the transport and storage of hydrogen. All these technologies rely on the development of a large spectrum of novel materials that make them affordable, dependable, and clean. This will be the paradigm that will drive the way we move and live.
