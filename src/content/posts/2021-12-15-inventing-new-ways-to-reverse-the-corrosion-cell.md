  ships. From an engineering perspective, it is an essential tool for protecting
  structures everywhere. Some of the more demanding sectors of CP include O&G,
  water & wastewater, industrial plants, ships, and nearshore structures in
  general. By application, pipelines are in the first place, followed by storage
  tanks, processing plants, and transmission towers. The cost savings associated
  with using the CP are not easy to estimate. Besides, global calculations
  showed that in 2018 the CP market was USD $4.265 million. According to an
  estimated CAGR of 5%, it is expected that such an amount could be about USD
  $7.064 million in 2027. Consequently, there is a strong reason for a growing

  first one is about applying energy transition to CP using solar energy to
  protect concrete rebar. One more example is related to the application of CP
  in a vital situation related to the energy transition. This is the case of CP

As all of us know, cathodic protection – CP - is one of the oldest and most efficient anti-corrosion methods; 200 years ago, our colleague Humphrey Davy recommended the technique to control corrosion on British naval ships. From an engineering perspective, it is an essential tool for protecting structures everywhere. Some of the more demanding sectors of CP include O&G, water & wastewater, industrial plants, ships, and nearshore structures in general. By application, pipelines are in the first place, followed by storage tanks, processing plants, and transmission towers. The cost savings associated with using the CP are not easy to estimate. Besides, global ***[calculations](https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/cathodic-protection-market)*** showed that in 2018 the CP market was USD $4.265 million. According to an estimated CAGR of 5%, it is expected that such an amount could be about USD $7.064 million in 2027. Consequently, there is a strong reason for a growing interest in the subject and searching for better answers concerning CP use.

**A requested recognition**

**​**

**Patent granter:** US Patent & Trademark Office - USPTO

**Application No.:** 20190071782

**Title:** *Cathodic corrosion protection with solar panel*

**Author(s):** David William Whitmore

**Applicant(s):** David William Whitmore

**Priority date:** 05.09.2017

**Summary:** An assembly comprising a flexible solar panel, energy storage, an anode, and the corresponding method of calculating solar panels and anodes requirements. A system used for cathodically protecting concrete rebar and automatic monitoring of its behavior. A technology that is useful even for inside concrete structures with low ambient light levels.

**Patent granter:** US Patent & Trademark Office - USPTO

**Application No.:** 20200232103

**Title:** *Cathodic protection for offshore wind turbine steel support structures*

**Author(s):** Birit Buhr Jensen

**Applicant(s):** Orsted Wind Power A/S

**Priority date:** 28.01.2020

**Summary:** In this case, the applicant's claims are concerned with a cylindrical support for offshore wind turbines. Inside the structure is located a control unit, and on the outside pole surfaces, galvanic anodes are placed. The control unit contains reference electrodes to estimate the polarization requirements of the structure. According to the variability of the required protection, the spatial distribution of the anodes can be calculated and the rate of electrons flowing towards the cathode controlled.

**Title:** *Apparatus and Method for In-Situ Cathodic Protection of Piggable Water Pipelines*

**Author(s):** Husain Makki Al-Mahrous

**Applicant(s):** Saudi Arabian Oil Company

**Priority date:** 28.04.2020

**Summary:** The declared invention refers to a pig device able to clean the inner surface of a pipeline. Such a device includes an anode of mixed metal oxide, platinized niobium, and titanium, encapsulated in a cured wax cementitious material containing mullite and corundum. Thus, the pig simultaneously acts as anode of a cell where the pipeline becomes cathodic thanks to the external electric current impressed.

​

Augmented reality AR made the buzz a few years ago, although AR was born as a key technology in this research, at the time the plan's allies felt it was not being used positively in construction, for one of the organization's automotive customers interested in minimizing shop floor errors and waste, the use was so successful that productivity increased by 20% and errors were nearly zero. Kit-AR is now installed in a different process on the buyer's assembly line to minimize critical errors and facilitate line balancing.
