# From The Editor's Corner

# **Cost matters!**

​\
​\
**What about the cost of corrosion?**

​\
​A holistic engineering view of any situation includes considerations about engineering economics. Then, any corrosion engineering consideration must consist of economic aspects, too. As a result, the cost of corrosion is a critical consideration in anti-corrosion decisions. Much of the time, corrosion engineering criteria are supported by economic factors. Otherwise, the consolidated cost of corrosion by countries has made headlines. Sometimes, the impact of the news has trespassed the news and influenced decision-makers. The results have been the promotion and fostering of educational programs, research centers, and R&D funding. However, new and updated estimations of the national yearly cost of corrosion are the same as the Gross Domestic Product - GDP percentage, as 40 or 50 years ago. In principle, efforts are not enough, and, from our point of view, awareness of the C-level position in companies is usually low or none. In addition, today, some other criteria about cost, ahead of the economic, must be the cost of corrosion regarding the risk of affection of the environment and health of leaving beings. In other words, the cost of corrosion is a question of every individual. Educating all people about selecting a material, its proper use, and caring is a duty of these times.

​**The IMPACT of corrosion in Canada**

​

The Labor Management Cooperation Initiative (LMCI) of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (**[IUPAT](https://www.iupat.org/)**) and NACE International Northern Area (currently the Association for Materials Protection and Performance, **[AMPP](https://www.nace.org/home)**) joined efforts. A few weeks ago launched a report about the impact of corrosion on the Canadian economy, entitled “**[2021 IMPACT Canada](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NACE/cedda8a4-c3c0-4583-b1b6-3b248e6eb1f2/UploadedImages/Resources/pdf/IMPACT-CANADA-2021.pdf)**”. This research was coordinated by our colleague **[Monica Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%B3nica-hern%C3%A1ndez-5936963/?originalSubdomain=ca)** (Infinity Growth Co.). And contributions by the renowned colleagues Pierre Crevolin (**[Caproco](https://www.caproco.com/)**), Nafiseh Ebrahimi (**[National Research Council Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en)**), **[Rob Phillips](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-phillips-5803b14/?originalSubdomain=ca)** (Commercial Sandblasting and Painting), Jack White, **[Sandy Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-williamson-b0684411/?originalSubdomain=ca)** (Williamson Integrity Services), and Dennis Zadery (**[Stantec](https://www.stantec.com/en)**). The industry sectors analyzed were energy (O&G, pipelines, utilities), industry (automotive, steel, and pulp & paper), mining, and transportation. Researchers determined the implemented corrosion and sustainability management practices during the design, manufacturing, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning in each sector.

​

In some way, the study above may be associated with the recognition of Canada as one of the countries of greatest concern for corrosion issues and one of the more recognized communities of professionals devote to its prevention and control. As such, the results indicated that all sectors had acceptable corrosion process management. However, proper asset handling requires improving subjects as policies, resources, organization, accountability, and communication. The results showed that entities should be attentive to the issues initially mentioned. Also, they must enhance the work that has been developed by now.

​\
​

The above results agree with figures that showed that the yearly cost of corrosion in Canada moved from USD $41.000 million in 2005 to USD $51.900 in 2019. That means 2.98% of the GDP. Such figures support initial concerns about a near-linear increase in the cost of corrosion with economic development or a "static" effect of anti-corrosion measures, despite so many efforts and advances in R&D. Here, some of the questions arising are related to how enough the efforts are? How translational to the field are the lab results? How big is the gap between academy and industry? And is the academy-industry-government Triple Helix synergy the key for attending to the asset handling gaps founded by the study? This last question is directly connected with other underlined findings that 15 to 35% of the annual cost of corrosion in the country can be saved by implementing existing mitigation practices.

​

In the end, the report's main recommendations focus on business culture, facing management of corrodible assets looking for minimizing risks for assets, infrastructure, productivity, lives, and the environment. Simultaneously, of course, optimizing economic, but also the sustainability of the operations. Suggestions are associated with knowledge generation and transfer through a strategic view. Without any doubt, a list of advice focuses on answering many of the mentioned worries at the beginning. They are:

​\
● Public policy initiatives towards

● An increased and spread knowledge of corrosion.

● The development of a more skilled workforce.

● Stronger corrosion-focused training bodies.

● Train, re-train, and upskill actions.

● A proper corrosion management system framework.

​\
​

**This responsibility cannot be avoided anymore**

​\
​All the countries and companies must follow Canada’s example and estimate the impact of corrosion in their daily economy and ahead. This is an obligation in the face of the challenges of sustainability, the Circular Economy, and the new social demands that the current evolution is bringing towards what can be called post-globalization. As mentioned in the presentation of Canada’s assessment, “policymakers need evidence to develop policies and programs that help solve costly problems like corrosion.” It is a societal must of public and private leaders in charge of the use and handling engineering materials and infrastructure, all the concerned rulers in general. We are **[experts](https://www.arroyave.co/)** on such a subject, and we can support interested entities in doing that.

The main objectives of the initiative are to ensure continued US leadership in AI R&D; leading the world in the development and use of reliable artificial intelligence systems in the public and private sectors; preparing the current and future US workforce for the integration of AI systems in all sectors of the economy and society; and coordinating ongoing AI activities among all Federal agencies to ensure that each informs the work of the other.

​

To support the initiative, the NAIIA, acting through the NAII Office, interagency committees, and agency chairs, has directed the President to maintain consistent support for AI R&D, support AI education and workforce training programs, support, plan and plan interdisciplinary AI research and education programs. directs. Coordinating federal interagency AI activities, providing access to diverse stakeholders, leveraging existing federal investment to advance Initiative goals, supporting an interdisciplinary network of AI research institutes, and support opportunities for international collaboration with strategic allies on R&D, evaluation, and resources for reliable AI systems.
