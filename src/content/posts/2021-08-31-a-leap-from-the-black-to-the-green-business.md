  Coming from the Scandinavian region is also a further headline over the
  current days. As mentioned earlier, over 7% of the total CO2 emitted worldwide
  comes from the steelmaking process. Consequently, some companies are working
  hard to find alternative pathways to coal usage, both as a reagent and
  combustible of the process. One of such companies is HYBRIT, a consortium
  which motto is “fossil-free steel,” aimed to develop an ironmaking technology
  based on green hydrogen. This past August 18, the Company announced the launch
  of the world's first fossil-free steel.

  ​It is the point of departure for use or storage, and solutions include direct carbon capture in the air. Technologies about that are just budding, but they are gaining traction. According to the IPCC report, up to 1.000.000 million tons of CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere, and the current capacity is only 5.000 per year. One of the present limits is the considerable amount of reagents needed, both liquid and solid, and energy due to the high temperature and low efficiency of existing processes. As a result, costly solutions. The good news is that there are projects like the one developed by Climeworks in Switzerland, funded with USD $10 million by the reinsurer Swiss Re Group. In this case, the funders recognize the impact of climate change on their business. During this time, the project proponent seeks to remove the atmospheric pollutant directly from the atmosphere and dissolve it in water to pump into the deep subsoil for permanent storage. CO2 capture is a challenge. The recent scientific literature shows several attempts. For example, microporous hollow fiber sorbents treated with polyethylenimine have been tested. As a result, an uptake rate of 2.8 mmol-CO2/g-fiber has been reported. In addition, a recent announcement mentioned a partnership between GE Research and the universities of California – Berkeley and South Alabama, in the USA. In this case, they are developing a two-year, USD $2 million project funded by the US Department of Energy. They aim to obtain a 3D printed heat exchanger technology coated with a metal-organic framework (MOF) sorbent and sorbent binder composite to capture and release CO2.

# From The Editor's Corner

# **A leap from the black to the green business**

​\
​

**Good and bad news**

​\
In the never-ending struggle between good and bad press titles, usually, the first ones win. Always, thanks to the human capacity of changing problems into challenges and inventing the corresponding solutions. As a result, one of the news last days was about ***[Yara](https://www.yara.com/)***, the multinational fertilizer company based in Norway (one of the main global crude oil producers). According to the ***[OECD](https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/07cuttingco2.pdf)***, transportation contributes 27% of global CO2 emissions, and 80% of this last figure is due to trucks and cars. Consequently, Yara decided to buy a ship, the “***[Yara Birkeland](https://t.co/k2kHVuRYfp?amp=1)***,” the first electric and uncrewed cargo ship globally, with batteries charged by the Norwegian hydroelectric system, to be used for transporting their products. In the end, about 40.000 truck trips off the road will be avoided yearly by using a green electric ship instead.

​\
​

Coming from the Scandinavian region is also a further headline over the current days. As ***[mentioned](https://news.materials.business/08/12/2020/lets-revolutionize-steelmaking-again)*** earlier, over 7% of the total CO2 emitted worldwide comes from the steelmaking process. Consequently, some companies are working hard to find alternative pathways to coal usage, both as a reagent and combustible of the process. One of such companies is ***[HYBRIT](https://www.hybritdevelopment.se/en/)***, a consortium which motto is “fossil-free steel,” aimed to develop an ironmaking technology based on green hydrogen. This past August 18, the Company announced the launch of the world's first fossil-free steel.

​\
​

Depending on the point of view, the good or bad news is announcing coal mines decommissioning and the ***[growing limitation](https://www.bigissue.com/latest/environment/is-your-bank-funding-fossil-fuels-find-out-with-this-free-tool/)*** to fund fossil fuels. Harsh news is also to know that emission levels continue to increase quickly (***[power sector CO2 emissions were 7% higher in June 2021 than June 2019](https://ember-climate.org/project/global-electricity-review-h1-2021/)***) and storms, wildfires, and flooding too. Besides, in a ***[report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)*** from the last 7th of August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) draws some emission scenarios. One of its findings is that without a 50% greenhouse gas - GHG - reduction, the global temperature increase could exceed 1.5°C after 2050.

​\
​

But another positive current ***[news](https://www.energy.gov/fe/articles/our-new-name-also-new-vision?mc_cid=77f1c9c92b&mc_eid=88a7fe951a)*** is related to the transformation of the US agency in charge of the development and usage of fossil fuels, towards a new one also in charge of carbon management, including the combat against CO2 emission, by reducing generation, transforming it into new products, and storing it properly. “A new name with a new vision”: Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management of the U.S. Department of Energy. Here, we are talking about a new field of engineering envisioned by ***[S. Pacala and R. Socolow](about:blank)*** in 2004, as “Carbon, Capture, Usage, and Storage – CCUS” or a set of technologies to remove CO2 from the flue gas and from the atmosphere, followed by recycling the CO2 for utilization and determining safe and permanent storage options. It is a key decarbonization strategy that becomes an alleviation for the coal, oil, and gas producers, including countries, companies, and the vast amount of Corrosionists dealing with asset integrity, mainly in the O&G industry.

​\
​

Nice is to hear the ***[news](https://www.economist.com/business/billions-are-pouring-into-the-business-of-decarbonisation/21803649?utm_campaign=the-economist-this-week&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&utm_term=2021-08-19&utm_content=ed-picks-article-link-3&etear=nl_weekly_3)*** about starting the trend of venture capitalists towards climate innovations and decarbonization. Directly related is the fact that new patents concerning non-fossil fuels and CCUS are ***[snowballing](https://www.iea.org/reports/patents-and-the-energy-transition)***. Without any doubt, new energy sources and the new field of CCUS open new opportunities and challenges for Corrosionist and our startups because new processes, new materials, new operating conditions, new storage requirements, etc., must be managed, and caring of assets will become more critical, even.

​\
​\
​**Carbon capture or sequestration**

​

It is the point of departure for use or storage, and solutions include direct carbon capture in the air. Technologies about that are just budding, but they are gaining traction. According to the IPCC report, up to 1.000.000 million tons of CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere, and the current capacity is only 5.000 per year. One of the present limits is the considerable amount of reagents needed, both liquid and solid, and energy due to the high temperature and low efficiency of existing processes. As a result, costly solutions. The good ***[news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/swiss-re-signed-a-10-million-carbon-capture-deal)*** is that there are projects like the one developed by ***[Climeworks](https://climeworks.com/)*** in Switzerland, funded with USD $10 million by the reinsurer ***[Swiss Re Group](https://www.swissre.com/)***. In this case, the funders recognize the impact of climate change on their business. During this time, the project proponent seeks to remove the atmospheric pollutant directly from the atmosphere and dissolve it in water to pump into the deep subsoil for permanent storage. CO2 capture is a challenge. The recent scientific literature shows several attempts. ***[For example](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c02289)***, microporous hollow fiber sorbents treated with polyethylenimine have been tested. As a result, an uptake rate of 2.8 mmol-CO2/g-fiber has been reported. In addition, a recent announcement mentioned a partnership between GE Research and the universities of California – Berkeley and South Alabama, in the USA. ***[In this case](https://netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/netl-file/21DAC_Moore.pdf)***, they are developing a two-year, USD $2 million project funded by the US Department of Energy. They aim to obtain a 3D printed heat exchanger technology coated with a metal-organic framework (MOF) sorbent and sorbent binder composite to capture and release CO2.

​\
​\
​**Storing and using carbon**

​

The sequestered CO2 could be sent into space and eventually deposited in extraterrestrial bodies. But much easier is to inject in the ground, in underground salt formations and others, as a precursor to carbon mineralization in new geological constituents.

​\
​

Usage is another option, and here it is possible to think about the temporal or “permanent” fixing of the pollutant. ***[For instance](https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal)***, the captured GHG for products like fuels and raw materials for chemicals, polymers, beverages, ***[biofuels, and omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.lanzatech.com/2020/12/14/universal-carbon-dioxide-platform-for-production-of-sustainable-food-fuels-and-chemicals/)*** would quickly re-release carbon into the atmosphere. But attractive applications, mainly for the heavy industry, like carbon cured concrete and synthetic aggregate in construction materials, DRI steel produced, and other alloys or plastics can provide long-term storage.

​\
​

It is easy to understand that ***[CO2 usage](https://cen.acs.org/articles/98/i39/convert-CO2-threat-asset.html)*** is receiving significant attention from researchers. Thus, in 2020 scientists published over 1700 papers in comparison with less than 500 ten years ago. Attractive for Corrosionists is that from the cost point of view, electrochemical pathways are the most promising for the GHG reduction to CO for the procurement of new raw materials for the industry in general, and for the fuels sectors, in particular. Methane, methanol, ethane, ethanol, ethylene, or propane are potential products. But the efficiency is still very low, and the cost of the required electricity is higher than the value of the chemicals produced. However, an exciting exercise of Circular Economy looks in perspective.

​\
​

The race for the energy transition and CCUS as a green business just has started. Momentum is growing. Innovation is the "fuel,” and discoveries and scaling await the Corrosionists’ proposals and solutions. The energy generation processes and the industrial applications are evolving, and opportunities arise.
