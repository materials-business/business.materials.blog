**Corrosionists are innovating as they should**

“Right now” is past tense. Future is what really matters. Corrosionists are concerned about the challenges that are emerging—old issues, but also new ones. Duties to be attended amid global threats as never existed before. But with marvelous tools to do our work, most of them are oriented towards the digitalization of our physical world. Looking towards the future, it is valuable to watch what our colleagues are patenting nowadays. Keeping this idea in mind, below are curated three requests of patents concerning corrosion and protection, published just a few weeks ago. Patent applications were submitted to IP offices of three of the most innovative countries currently: the USA, Korea, and the People's Republic of China.

**Protection of electronic circuits.** Looking at the trends of the presence of accelerated growth of the electronics presence in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, some months before, we asked for “*[A doctor for Sophia.”](https://news.materials.business/22/12/2020/a-doctor-for-sophia)* The first summary below concerns a nanocoating developed to repel water from printed circuit boards, avoiding corrosion—An innovation impacting many of the activities currently developed everywhere.

**Better assets protection.** The second summary presents an example of how to take advantage of the confluence of emerging technologies to improve maintenance and anticorrosive work by painting structures and buildings. Artificial intelligence and blockchain are combined to achieve recommendations about the holistic handling of a painting procedure of buildings and similar.

**Batteries are a key issue in the energy transition.** It is well known that the bottleneck in moving towards energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal is energy storage. In principle, batteries are a great option. However, most of the time, conditions inside batteries are extremely aggressive, and corrosion problems are huge. Improving the corrosion resistance of batteries is an actual challenge. The last request for a patent summarized below is related to increasing the corrosion resistance of one of the most standing batteries today, the Li batteries.

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** The United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO

**Application No.:** 20220002559

**Title:** *Coatings for waterproofing electronic components*

**Author(s):** John L. Zimmerman, John D. McGee, Gregory T. Donaldson, Thomas S. Smith, II, William G. Kozak, Lisa K. Miller, and Eric C. Kuhns.

**Applicant (s):** Henkel AG & Co.

**Publication date:** 06.01.2022

**Summary:** The asked recognition is related to a coating aimed to achieve water resistance capabilities of printed circuit boards. The formulation includes an organosulphur compound (mercapto silane oligomer; an antifungal azole as passivating agents; an ethylene-vinyl acetate block copolymer as film-forming agent; and additives (dispersed wax particles, etc.). Furthermore, there are included methods of making and applying ultrathin coating layers. A coating that after can be removed by peeling.

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** Korean Intellectual Property Office – KIPO

**Application No.:** 20220011755

**Title:** *Method for controlling repair and painting work using artificial intelligence*

**Author(s):** Bomin Choi

**Applicant (s):** TCS Co., Ltd.

**Publication date:** 28.01.2022

**Summary:** Pictorial information is transmitted digitally furnished to an artificial intelligence tool, including a convolutional neural network in a blockchain network. The resulting output is a graphical program of painting and maintenance of the pictured structure. It is a program that includes blocks of distributed information about the recommended intervention, the materials required, the working procedure, and the general management.

**A requested recognition**

**Patent granter:** China National Intellectual Property Administration - CNIPA

**Application No.:** 114050270

**Title:** *Preparation method of Al, Co and Li Co-coated lithium cobaltate material for high voltage*

**Author(s):** Pei-Dong Li, Wen-Sheng Xu, Pan Liu, and Shuang-Shuang Zhou

**Applicant (s):** Tianjin Lantian Solar Tech Co ltd

**Publication date:** 15.02.2022

**Summary:** It is presented a process for obtaining lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2), using cobalt oxide and lithium as the precursors of a high-temperature sintering reaction (900 – 1150 °C, during 6 – 16 h), and a dopant (Al, Zr, Ti, Y, Mg, Co, Sr, Mo, La, or W). A reaction on an Al, Co, or Li-Co surface, which becomes cladded to be used as an electrode of a high voltage storage battery.

**Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is a profitable business!**

**A great player in the worldwide iron and steel market**

Geopolitical and environmental situations are influencing the global steel market. In the case of Turkish, *[internal factors](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/publication/economic-monitor)* concerning a high stock of raw materials during the pandemic and its recent profound money devaluation are adding advantages for its goods in the international market. As a result, the Turkish iron and steel industry is becoming an even stronger exporter. In *[2021](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/37035/Turkey-Economic-Monitor-Sailing-Against-the-Tide.pdf)*, Turkey was the seventh country by crude steel production (behind China, India, Japan, United States, Russia, and Korea), with 40.4 million tons, accounting for 2.1% of the global production. Almost 50% of such amount was exported, and the European Union was the absorber of more than 40% of the total iron and steel sold abroad. Current trends show that the performance of the Turkish steelmaking industry in 2022 will be even higher.

**Aerogels for the Circular Economy challenges**

*[EMPA](https://www.empa.ch/web/empa/)*, the Switzerland Institute for Materials Science and Technology, has opened a call for projects from architects, civil engineers, and students dealing with aerogels for solving issues in construction, refurbishment, and preservation and conservation of cultural heritage. EMPA considers this last subject as one of great potential. According to one of its *[scientific reports](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.culher.2019.09.007)*, aerogels have unique properties in heritage preservation and refurbishing because of their preservation possibilities, maintaining authenticity, integrity, reversibility, and compatibility. In addition, properties such as high thermal isolation capacity and translucent daylighting allow many other options regarding architecture and civil engineering issues.

# Networking & Knowledge Exchange

**A great meeting of a strong community of Corrosionists**

In-person. *[ACA](https://membership.corrosion.com.au/)*, the Australasian Corrosion Association –will be hosting its periodic regional conference “Corrosion & Prevention - C&P.” As traditionally, this magnificent event is supported by several companies, universities, and research centers. Some of the most recognized Australian Corrosionists are invited as plenary lectures, included Mariano Iannuzzi (Curtin University), Nick Birbilis (The Australian National University), Maria Forsyth (Deakin University), Robert Melchers (The University of Newcastle), Ted Riding (Jotum), and Sarah Furman (AECOM). The meeting will comprise a program of keynote presentations and technical papers under a range of industry streams, integrated with an exhibition that will showcase products and services of the corrosion mitigation industry.

**Dateline for abstracts submission**: Monday, March 21 of 2022.

**Dates:** Sunday to Wednesday, June 5 to 8 of 2022.

**Venue:** Newcastle Exhibition and Convention Center, Australia.

*<https://conference.corrosion.com.au/>*

**Let’s talk about mechanical-assisted corrosion**

Virtual. The next talk of the CorroZoom series hosted by the Fontana Corrosion Center at the Ohio State University, USA, will be given by Jenifer (Warner) Locke, an assistant professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Fontana Corrosion Center at The Ohio State University. The speech will be related with “Recent Advances in Understanding Corrosion Fatigue, Stress Corrosion Cracking, and the Interaction of the Two”. Jenifer will be presenting results of her research on the interplay between corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion cracking in Al-Mg alloys for naval applications. She will show how the resistance to corrosion-fatigue is increasingly degraded as the fatigue loading frequency is decreased for heavily sensitized microstructures. Jenifer will also explain how the corrosion-fatigue resistance loss is triggered by loads that promote SCC.

**Date:** Wednesday, March 23 of 2022.

**Time:** 08:00 EST (GMT – 4)
