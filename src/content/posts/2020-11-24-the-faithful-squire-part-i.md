# **THE FAITHFUL SQUIRE - Part I**

**Galvanic series**

Luigi Galvani (1737–1798), Professor at the University of Bologna, was another on the list of recognized Italian scientists who contributed to the fundamentals of the current scientific knowledge. As a physician and physicist, Galvani was able to combine his efforts and identify both physiological and physical phenomena. Researching bioelectricity in 1780, he discovered that the nature of a pair of metals (the electrodes) played an important role in the flow rate of electricity along nerves. In the beginning, he used brass and Iron; then experimented with other pairs of metals. This was the discovery of the battery principles, but Galvani did not note that. However, Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), a friend of Galvani, used such effect and invented the galvanic cell or voltaic pile in 1800, using copper and Zinc as electrodes, and saltwater as the electrolyte.

Conditions are ready for the development of electrochemistry along the XIX Century, and some of the developments are labeled remembering Galvani. One of them concerns the arrangement of the pairs of elements or electrodes in a specific electrolyte, or **galvanic series**, according to their behavior as anodic or cathodic immersed in an electrolyte. An abbreviated list of materials acting as cell electrodes in seawater includes:

​

**CATHODIC TREND**

Platinum

Gold

316 Stainless steel

Nickel

Lead

Tin

Copper

Yellow brass

Chromium (plated on steel)

**Mild steel, cast Iron**

Aluminum alloys

**Zinc**

Magnesium

**ANODIC TREND**​\
​

Also, a cathodic trend means the option of finding such an element in a pure natural state. On the contrary, the anodic trend means less or none option of finding it as a pure natural element. Curiously, the first ones are classified as noble materials, while the others are called active ones. Such simple categorization is so powerful that many of the counter corrosion measurements are based on it. More noble materials are cathodically protected by others in the lower part of the list. This is the benefit of some of the pairs of metals used extensively in engineering. It is well known that steel is the engineering material par excellence, the “Master Metal.” This due to the good combination of mechanical properties. Nevertheless, its usual low corrosion resistance is a matter of concern, and one way is by pairing with other less noble, more active material.

​

**The star steward**

But who is the defender? We are talking about Zinc, one of the more reactive metals, or one of the more plebeian metals, withstands corrosive attack, protecting steel. From the thermodynamic point of view, Zn is extremely active. But from the kinetical standpoint, usually, the Zinc rate dissolution is very low because of passivation effects. These and some other reasons are more than enough to talk about the couple steel/Zn as one of the more important engineering pairs. Zn is a metallic chemical element, the first in group 12 of the **[Periodic Table](https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/podcast/30/Zinc)**. Consequently, it has a relatively lower melting (419.5°C) and boiling (907°C) points. The density of 7.134 g cm−3. Zn was known by Chinese, Indians, Greeks, and Romans more than 20 centuries ago but identified as a chemical element in 1746 by Andreas Marggraf (German chemist, 1709 – 1782). Some authors associate its name with the Latin word Zincum, which means a white thin layer of white sediments. Main ore sources are blende or sphalerite (ZnS), and hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7(OH)2·H2O). The highest production comes from China, Australia, Peru, India, the USA, Mexico, Canada, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, and Ireland. Currently, yearly global production is around 13 million tons. The estimated world reserves are 1900 million tonnes.

​

As always, following the thermodynamic cycle of “returning to the earth,” Zn corrodes and goes back to their origins. For instance, corrosion products include oxides (Zincite, ZnO), sulfides (Wurtzite, ZnS), sulfates (Zincosite, ZnSO4), chlorides (Simonkolleite, Zn5Cl2(OH)8H2O), and carbonates (Smithsonite, ZnCO3, and Hydrocinzite, Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6).

​

**On the shoulders of giants**

People had spent more than 2000 years using Iron and its alloys, and living together with corrosion problems, without any truly effective defense. Just accepting a natural process like it is, but no counter measurements. Just bare metals exposed to the attack of the environment. However, in the XVIII Century, even at the alchemist times, there was news about the immersion of clean steel in molten Zn, and obtaining the characteristic silvered coating. Such a process was described in a paper presented to the French Royal Academy in 1742, and therefore Zn coated household utensils were fairly well known in parts of France during the second half of that Century **[\-Source-](https://www.galvanizing.org.uk/hot-dip-galvanizing/history-of-galvanizing/)**.

Then, some years after the contributions by Galvani and Volta, in 1824, Sir Humphry David, assisted by Michael Faraday, published some papers describing the possibility of protection of copper by sacrificial anodes of Iron, Tin, or Zinc. This was the starting point of the cathodic protection technique, which was consolidated along the first half of the next century, mainly as an answer to the petrochemical industry requirements. In 1836, the French civil engineer, chemist, and inventor Stanislas Sorel (1803 – 1871) was the first to patent a process for coating steel by dipping in molten Zn. Sorel named the process “galvanizing,” an attractive word at that time because of the electric shocks proposed by Galvani, and reminding him again. In 1837, William Crawford awarded a similar British patent, too. The first in the field use of galvanized iron was done by the UK Navy at Pembroke Docks, Wales in 1844. According to the British Galvanizer Association, by 1850, the galvanizing industry was using 10,000 tons of zinc a year for the protection of iron. A great boost of galvanized steel happened during the first half of the XX Century, due to the two world wars, mainly.

​

A 2020 market report shows that consumption is growing. Nowadays, 60 percent of Zn produced worldwide is used for protecting steel against corrosion. Common products include sheet and strip, structure, pipe and tube, and wire and hardware. According to the end-user/application, approx. percentage by use of galvanized steel is distributed in a wide spectrum of sectors: Construction (36%), urban furniture (27%), agriculture (13%), transport infrastructure (9%), utilities (5%), and miscellaneous. A list of top key players in the market includes Baowu Group, ThyssenKrupp, POSCO, ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel, and Sumitomo Metal, Hesteel Group, Hyundai Steel, Gerdau, United States Steel Corporation, China Steel Corporation, Tata Steel, and Valin Steel Group.\
​

**Why does a commoner act nobly?**

The empirical and scientific developments have been approaching little by little, explaining various facts and behaviors, and opening new and more rational options. So now we can explain why a metal that is very far from the nobles is capable of acting nobly. In the beginning, it is good to think about the electrochemical corrosion cell established in common conditions of a corrosive attack like atmospheric, by soils, by water, or chemicals. The two electrodes, cathode under protected conditions, and anode under a dissolution regime are electrically connected, allowing the flux of electrons and, besides, connected through an electrolyte, allowing the flux of ions, too. Any anti-corrosive measurement means the intervention of such a cell. A physical, chemical, or electrochemical modification. In the case of galvanized steel, one of the counter measurements is the establishment of a physical barrier between the steel substrate and the corrosive environment by the Zn coating. Consequently, characteristics like thickness, impermeability, and compactness are directly related to the protective capacity. Furthermore, in the case of anticorrosive coatings, adherence with the substrate is relevant. Here, there is one of the advantages of hot-dip galvanizing, due to the metallurgical alloying between steel and Zn, and an intimate contact between them, avoiding the option of an inner surface or void. Instead, it is structured as a gradient of compositions from the inner steel substrate until the outer pure Zn.

​

Furthermore, Zn can give cathodic protection to the Fe alloys. A measure of this difference is found comparing the equilibrium potentials (Ep) against a standard counter electrode. As the Galvanic Series showed above, Zn is anodic to iron. Ep is -763 and – 440 mV vs. the Standard Hydrogen Electrode, respectively. In other words, there is a gradient of the potential of 323 mV, able to easily promote the establishment of an electrochemical corrosion cell between iron and its alloys and Zn. Where the Zn is dissolved, meanwhile the ferrous counter electrode is safeguarded. Usually, the last one is the material that must be protected and ends up sacrificed. Zn as a sacrificial anode gives some advantages as protection on uncoated areas of the substrate (scratches, holes, edges, and other defects). Also, some of the principles of cathodic protection are valid here. For instance, the current capacity of Zn, concerning the relation of cathodic and anodic areas (Zn and substrate exposed areas), is very important. Zn as a sacrificial anode must yield enough number of electrons per unit mass and should deliver these electric charges efficiently. Some calculations show that the theoretical efficiency of pure Zn is 820 Ah.kg-1. Accordingly, an actual anode furnishing 0.1 Ah permanently will lose 1 kg of Zn yearly. Nevertheless, factors concerning the kinetics of the electrode reactions significantly influence, too.

​\
Variables of the process related to kinetics include corrosion products, their nature, amount, and so on. Also, the nature of the corrosive environment, and the way of the interaction between material and environment, or characteristics of the system material/corrosive. Talking about the nature of the corrosive environment, it is very well known the excellent behavior of galvanized steel in rural atmospheres, where protective action by conventional galvanized steel can last several decades. While in severe marine atmospheres, it lasts only a few years, at most **[\-Source-](https://galvanizeit.org/hot-dip-galvanizing/how-long-does-hdg-last/in-the-atmosphere/time-to-first-maintenance/zinc-coating-life-predictor/)**. Moreover, considering the nature of the corrosion products, there is a passivation phenomenon associated to the generation of compounds like Zincite, Smithsonite, and Hydrozincite, tightly adherent, impermeable, and protective as an effective patina. In the end, a much better behavior of the material than the expected one. This is the main reason for the very good protection of steel by a much less noble Zn, a relatively cheap protection method that pays most of the time. **Remember: Protection of materials and equipment is good business!**
