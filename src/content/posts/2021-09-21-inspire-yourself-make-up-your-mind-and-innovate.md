  Patent granter: United States Patent and Trademark Office – USPTO


  Patent No.: 6,012,495


  Title: Corrosion protection for subsea lines


  Inventor(s): Roy Eivind Antonsen


  Applicant (s): Alcatel


  Date of patent: 11.01.2000


  Summary: This invention is related to a unique cathodic protection design of static subsea carbon steel umbilical lines or bundles of pipes, electrical cables, and so on. The basic design includes a carbon steel pipe protected by Al or Zn tape or strips in a permeable arrange where seawater acts as the electrolyte. The assembly guarantees the establishment of the right electrochemical cell, independent of the content of the pipeline or the configuration of the bundle.

  Application No.: 20210269671


  Title: Coating for anti-fouling and anti-corrosion on metals


  Author(s): Hanyang Zhao, Nenad Miljkovic


  Applicant (s): University of Illinois


  Priority date: 02.09.2021


  Summary: The submitted invention deals with the elimination or reduction of deposits on metallic surfaces (Al or Cu alloys, etc.) of interest like heat exchangers and other parts working at high temperature in equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and aviation and industrial systems. The novelty is a nano-coating including an intermediary layer formed on the substrate and a non-crosslinked omniphobic coating formed on the intermediary layer. According to the applicants, this thin and ultra-smooth coating can avoid scale or fouling formation or fixation by lowering the surface energy of the surface.

# From The Editor's Corner



# **Inspire yourself, make up your mind and innovate!**



We are again examining the vast database of useful technical information on more than 130 million patents currently available globally. Old inventions are supporting the new ones. New developments by your partners, rivals, and paradigmatic companies. Solutions for your current problems. Cutting and emerging technologies.

​

**Umbilical cords for the development of the blue economy**. A recently ended patent of high interest in the coming times is related to a cathodic protection design of cables and pipes extended under seawater. A crucial application for the physical connection of continents and islands and offshore activities included the emerging technologies about subsea architecture.

​\
​

**Corrosion prevention during packaging, storage, and transportation**. Secondly, we have a recently awarded patent recognized by the Korean patent office concerning** *[an issue of increasing importance](https://news.materials.business/02/03/2021/packaging-another-constantly-growing-market)*.** The delivery logistics chain is one of the more strengthened sectors during the Covid-19 pandemic and will be consolidated in the coming years. Therefore, proper packaging for conservation during storage and transportation is becoming more and more important. In particular, in the case of metallic parts and objects, corrosion prevention is a must.

​\
​

**Nanocoating against crust and scale**. Finally, we have found an application from the academy concerning an anticorrosive coating for high-temperature applications like heat exchangers. Basic scientific principles applied to practical engineering solutions. This innovation is based on the physicochemical changes achieved by a nano coating as a barrier for the nucleation of undesirable precipitates (scale, crusts, etc.) on the surface of interest.

​**A new invention granted (in force)**

**​**

**Patent granter:** Korean Intellectual Property Office - KIPO

**Patent No.:** KR20200053666A

**Title:** *Manufacturing method of a simultaneous volatile corrosion inhibitor pack and volatile corrosion inhibitor emitter*

**Inventor(s):** John Bockdong Kim, Michael Eundong Kim, Suk Choi Choo, Schlueter Lennart

**Applicant(s):** John & Eundong Co., Ltd., Safe Pack Sicherheitsverpackungen GmbH, Polartech Co., Ltd.

**Date of patent:** 21.12.2020

**Summary:** A new method of preparing a volatile corrosion inhibitor compound and a simultaneous moisture absorber for temporary packaging protection has been invented. The patent describes preparing a special pack able to absorb humidity and emit a volatile corrosion inhibitor. The pack absorbs the moisture inside the packages and emits a corrosion inhibitor vapor to protect the packaged metallic parts from any risk of later attack. The packing material is obtained by extruding polyethylene in a particular design geometry, mixed with doped with polyethylene wax, propylene glycol, and a mix of sodium molybdate, sodium benzoate, ammonium benzoate, benzotriazole, and sodium capriate as the vaporizable rust-preventing pulverized material. Then, the polymeric piece is wrapped with desiccant paper.

**​[Special Issue "Corrosion and Surface Modification of Metallic Materials"](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metals/special_issues/C_S_M)​**

**​**

Metallic materials are those materials most used daily and at the engineering level due to their versatility, resistance, and easy recyclability. One of the examples that shows these characteristics is steel, mainly used in various applications and environments to withstand extreme conditions such as weight support and temperature. Likewise, most industrial processes involve materials making contact with different types of fluids. This is how the parts exposed to the action of these fluids can present oxidation, thus rapidly reducing the usefulness of the pieces. Due to the relative movement of a corrosive fluid in contact with the metallic surface, the iron rust added to mechanical effects accelerates the corrosion rate of the metal. Additionally, if the fluid contains solids and suspended particles, the degradation effects on the material increase. As such, in recent years, advancements worldwide have made it possible to generate coatings that improve the properties of metals or maintain the integrity of the material under the effects of an aggressive medium that causes corrosion. This allows coatings to become the solution to this problem that impacts great economic losses worldwide.

**​**

The steel girders under the southbound bridge that carries US 321 over Lake Hickory need repair. Construction will likely begin in early 2022. The bridge is structurally inadequate. According to a bridge survey conducted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation - NCDOT, in April 2020, the bridge was built in 1962. For 60 years, water and de-icing salt have been reaching the steel girders of the southbound ribbon bridge. The sections will be cut and replaced with new pieces or steel plates where the steel beams are severely corroded. Once replaced and strengthened, the beams will be painted to protect against further corrosion.

**​**

SPEE3D has added 316L stainless steel to the list of materials that can now be used with its cold spray metal additive manufacturing machines, paving the way for applications in the oil and gas industry. SPEE3D machines use a cold fusion process where compressed air is used to fuse the powders, which means that no volatile gas or heat source is needed to bind the layers together. “NERA's support in developing our ability to print 316L stainless steel has been crucial,” commented Steve Camilleri, co-founder of SPEE3D.

“We expect industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to increase approximately 8% through mid-2022, based on the economic recovery that supports the demand for base metals, iron ore, steel, and coal,” said Barbara Mattos, Moody's Senior Vice President. Most base metal prices are showing signs of stability in 2022 after hitting historic highs this year. Among key base metals, aluminum prices will remain high until at least mid-2022, and copper prices will remain strong until at least late 2022, compared to historical averages.
