# From The Editor's Corner

# **Avoidance of mistakes is a must**

​\
​

**Preventing misunderstandings**​\
​

These days, one of the shocking technology headlines is the growing international concern associated with Apple's decision to scan encrypted images into the iPhone. According to the Company, the purpose is to combat and avoid children’s sexual harassment. However, there is an international ***[controversy](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/17/1032113/apple-says-researchers-can-vet-its-child-safety-features-its-suing-a-startup-that-does-just-that/)*** centered on the fact of privacy being lost. In summary, it is an issue including different facets of the “right behavior”: caring for children and people in general and respecting privacy as an inherent right of each individual. Both cases are directly related to ethics. The situation described is a clear example of the growing ethical risks post-globalization faces due to new technologies: Artificial intelligence, social media, blockchain, sensorics, drones, etc. Corrosionists must be prepared to attend to the arriving challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and such readiness includes the proper preparation against ethical issues.

​

​\
We, the Corrosionists, well know what “corrosion” means. However, the average person often misunderstood the term and became confused about our specialty. This hesitation is easy to explain because the similarity with “corruption” is high, not only in the sound but in the definition, too. The ***[Longman dictionary of contemporary English](https://www.ldoceonline.com/)*** defines ethics as “**moral rules or principles of behavior for deciding what is right and wrong**.” And specifically referring to business, the definition of ethics is “**moral rules or principles of behavior that should guide members of a profession or organization and make them deal honestly and fairly with each other and with their customers**.” Without any doubt, some basic guidelines of our profession as Corrosionists. The same source defines corruption as “**dishonest, illegal, or immoral behavior, especially from someone with power.”** In principle, something utterly external to our duties. However, some others recognize a figurative use of “corrosion,” The ***[Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corrosion)*** presents as an example of the word usage, the sentence “**the corrosion of family values that is often brought on by great wealth**.” But corrosion is a natural process, fully explained by scientific principles, and corruption cannot be considered inherent to humankind, as some people try to show. Generally, any figurative word does not have sufficient support, and, indeed, corrosion is not corruption!

​\
​\
​**Tough Corrosionists**

​

Corrosionists are responsible for materials and assets reliability and span-life. That means productivity, competitiveness, and cost-effectiveness. But we are also speaking about risk prevention, including contamination, fire, health, life, and wellbeing perils. All are currently potentiated through global warming and the dangers and challenges of sustainability. Professionals with vast responsibilities combating corrosion failures, according to a series of well-established ethical principles, are based on a deal honestly and fairly with each other and our customers. We often heard about accidents, collapsed buildings, explosions, oil spills, etc. We are convinced that Corrosionists involved with the issues, if any, very well know the difference between both words.

​\
​

**Education as an armor**

​

Attitude in front of ethical issues is part of the culture. Consequently, education is fundamental, and such toughness must be maintained from the beginning and constantly reinforced. The culture evolved and new threats loom, and continuous education becomes essential. Education as individuals, as engineers, and as Corrosionists, we need in an age full of misinformation, fake news, and so on.

​\
​

A classic guidebook about being an ethical and successful engineer was published in Mechanical Engineering magazine **(*[ASME](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/memagazineselect/article/132/10/42/379991/The-Unwritten-Laws-of-EngineeringPart-1-of-3-What)*)** by W.J. King (General Electric engineer and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles) in 1944. This series of pieces of advices were entitled “The unwritten laws of engineering” (translated to Spanish by the close colleague Javier Chamorro, University of Antioquia, Medellin, 1981). The first part talks about “what the beginner needs to learn at once.” The second one concerns “relating chiefly to engineering managers,” The last article is on “professional and personal considerations.” Curiously, King calls attention to situations where it is much more trouble to violate undocumented engineering laws than by violating the laws of science. In other words, we may be wrong to apply engineering knowledge, but we should never break the rules of our behavior.

In the same direction, several companies, entities, and organizations look for the proper conduct of their associates, promoting ethical advice. I.e., a partnership between the Engineering Council and the Royal Academy of Engineering of the UK enables the “***[Statement of ethical principles for the engineering profession](https://www.engc.org.uk/professional-ethics)***.” In the beginning, the authors define “engineering professional” as “professional engineers and those technicians, tradespeople, students, apprentices, and trainees engaged in engineering.” In addition, say that “Non-engineers managing or teaching engineering professionals should be made aware of this Statement.” It is a list of principles bunched into four groups: Honesty and integrity; respect for life, law, the environment, and the public good; accuracy and rigor; and leadership and communication.

Ethics becomes another severe topic that should be explicitly included in academic programs.The ethical citizenry is more than crucial to facing the challenges of a better society for all in a sustainable world, as it quired in post-globalized times. Future humanitarian engineers, helping to build an egalitarian, fair and just society, fighting corruption and any other form of misconduct or crime. Courses and practices oriented to achieve active learning of ethical skills must be guaranteed by any engineering program. Following such a methodology, there are examples of good teaching practices as the collection of case studies developed by ***[Michael Pritchard](https://onlineethics.org/collection-detail/Cases%20for%20Teaching%20Engineering%20Ethics)***, which helps to explore several facets of the profession. Cases include, for example, situations concerning a request to ***[falsify data](https://onlineethics.org/cases/cases-teaching-engineering-ethics/requested-falsify-data)*** about the magnitude of a chemical spill; ***[exceeding pollution limits](https://onlineethics.org/cases/cases-teaching-engineering-ethics/exceeding-pollution-limits)*** in a plant’s water discharge, not reported assuming that the exceeding amount is so a little; a problem about the ***[cost of design improvement](https://onlineethics.org/cases/cases-teaching-engineering-ethics/cost-design-improvement)***, talking about a situation where the provider changes specifications and increase the cost of the product/service asking the customer for a higher payment, without a previous agreement. Or a ***[request from a former student](https://onlineethics.org/cases/cases-teaching-engineering-ethics/request-former-student)*** because an assistant student uses a report of the project as an essential part of their thesis without any authorization or reference to the project. As supposed, risks of unethical behavior exist in any professional activity, academia (education & research), business, government, etc. All of them, performance fields of Corrosionists. Considering our specific situation, AMPP is following the tradition by NACE, and right now is ***[offering](https://store.nace.org/ethics-for-the-corrosion-professional)*** a course about “Ethics for the Corrosion Professional,” aimed to teach how Corrosionist in charge of decision making (apprentices, technicians, salespersons, inspectors, quality control, managers, and engineers) can manage responsibilities protecting people, assets, and the environment. The course’s content includes a deep discussion of the NACE International Code of Ethics. In addition, the content consists of topics such as factors that lead to unethical decision-making, types of unethical behavior, and a framework for correct decisions.

​\
​

For sure, to act according to the ethical principles expected and required by society from Corrosionists pays. To know codes is a duty. Corrosionists, companies, associations, and governments must remain committed to what is within their reach.

**​[What are the Tokyo 2020 Olympic medals made of?](https://www.compoundchem.com/)**​

​

Japan’s considerable national effort was to collect enough recycled material to produce 5,000 bronze, silver, and gold medals for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The recycling campaign produced 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of gold, 7,700 pounds (3500 kg) of silver and 4,850 pounds (2200 kg) of bronze. All from nearly 80 tons of small electrical devices such as old phones and laptops. The ‘’gold’’ medal is made of 1,2% of gold and 98.8% of silver, by contrast the silver medal is the only of the three medals made without any alloy, 100% of silver, the bronze medal instead is made of 95% of copper and 5% of zinc. This year’s medals are the first to be made entirely from recycled metals.
